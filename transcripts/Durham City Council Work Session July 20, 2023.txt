02:40 Thank you.
02:41 All right, so we're going to move into our announcements from council.
02:44 And I'll start with my left hand and see if we have any announcements on this end.
02:51 Just prayers for the family.
02:54 and know that it's been a hard loss this summer
02:58 with the young lady and the little girl who was killed.
03:01 And I did want to thank all of our folks in the community
03:06 for rallying around that family.
03:08 That's a really difficult moment to have and experience.
03:14 I also wanted to say that I am continuing
03:18 to kind of wait on staff around some responses
03:23 I do want folks to know that it is a priority and I thank everyone for their advocacy around it.
03:30 That's all, thank you.
03:33 Councilwoman.
03:34 Thank you, good afternoon everyone.
03:36 Good afternoon to staff, good to see you all after our break.
03:39 I hope lots of you went away and got some time away.
03:42 And to my colleagues as well, that everyone got to rest up.
03:46 I know that we have lots of issues to work on this fall.
03:50 And then the other thing I just wanted to say is thank you to the students who came to visit us this morning for those
03:55 the mayor councilmember Freeman
03:57 Williams and dr. Halsey homin, and I were able to meet them this morning and it's always
04:02 Excellent to see some of our youth and they asked excellent questions
04:06 And it was a good way to start our work again with just some some great kids
04:11 And thanks to the staff who helped us get that ready. Thank you
04:14 Thank you.
04:17 Madam Mayor, good afternoon, ma'am.
04:18 Good to see you and good to see all of my colleagues.
04:19 Welcome back from what I hope was a restful
04:21 and rejuvenating break.
04:23 Just wanted to shout everybody out
04:24 and say it's a privilege to be back in Chamber.
04:26 I also want to send a shout-out to our administration
04:28 for a very, very strong hire of Christina Reardon,
04:32 officially as our Budget Director.
04:33 So kudos and congratulations to her.
04:36 Thank you, Madam Mayor.
04:38 Turning to my right, the announcements.
04:42 I'm sorry, to my left.
04:44 Again, good afternoon to our residents of Durham.
04:48 It's good to be back to work for you.
04:50 To my colleagues, I hope everybody had a rest.
04:52 I surely tried to do that rest,
04:54 even though I did teach through the summer
04:56 and still teaching.
04:57 But I also want to shout out all of our students
04:59 who are going back to school.
05:00 The year round schools have begun.
05:03 So I'm wishing them a productive year
05:05 and getting ready for our students
05:06 who will be going to traditional school coming up.
05:08 So just wanted to say that.
05:09 Thank you.
05:10 Thank you, Madam Mayor.
05:14 I slept and left town and it felt great.
05:17 So thank you, Dr. Ahmed.
05:20 Just welcome back.
05:21 It's great to see everyone again and shout out to the Strong Her, Together Her mentoring
05:27 group that came this morning to sit in our seats and take pictures with us and tour City
05:32 Hall.
05:33 Thank you all.
05:36 It is great to be back in this spot and continuing on with the business of the city.
05:41 As you notice, Deputy City Manager Bertha Johnson is beside me today and City Manager
05:49 Paige's place who is now out on a break herself.
05:54 So we hope that she's having a very restful break and we're glad to see our Chief Deputy
06:00 City Manager Johnson here beside us this afternoon.
06:04 It's been a busy summer, so, and it's going to be a busy fall.
06:08 So, let's get right to it.
06:10 And we will see if, I think we do have some priority items from our city manager, Sha.
06:17 Thank you.
06:17 Good afternoon, Mayor O'Neill, Mayor Pro Tem Middleton, city council members.
06:22 The city manager's office has three priority items today for you.
06:26 Agenda item 18, zoning map change, Fairhaven Walk.
06:30 The plan development residential PDR number was changed from 3.445 to 23.445 in the executive
06:38 summary section of the agenda member.
06:42 Agenda item number 19, the zoning map change 602 North Hoover Road.
06:47 The title of the proposed zoning and attachment A, zoning context map was changed from industrial
06:52 light IL to industrial light with development plan which is ILD.
06:59 Item number 20, consolidated annexation 631 and 633 Clayton Road consistency
07:06 statement attachment O was attached. That's all I have for you today.
07:10 Thank you Deputy City Manager Johnson. You have now heard the managers
07:17 priority items and may I please have a motion for their approval.
07:21 Moved. Second.
07:22 I move by Councilman Williams, I think seconded by Councilwoman Freeman.
07:29 All those in favor, if you would sign by saying aye.
07:32 Aye.
07:33 All those opposed have the same right.
07:34 Hearing none, that vote passes unanimously.
07:37 I now recognize our City Attorney for any priority items she may have.
07:42 Good afternoon, Madam Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem Middleton, members of the Council.
07:45 It's good to see you again.
07:47 The City Attorney's Office has one priority item this afternoon and that is a request
07:51 that the City Council hold a closed session at the conclusion of all regular business.
07:55 We request closed session for attorney-client consultation concerning the handling or settlement
08:01 in the following cases, Estate of Brooke Maynard versus City of Durham and Darryl Dowdy versus
08:07 City of Durham.
08:08 I am happy to provide the motion at the end of the meeting if you would prefer to vote
08:11 then.
08:12 We can do it now.
08:13 Okay.
08:14 So the motion is to hold a closed session pursuant to North Carolina General Statute
08:17 143 318.11a3 for attorney-client consultation concerning the handling or
08:24 settlement of a state of Brooke Maynard versus City of Durham that's 20 CVS 2645
08:30 filed in Durham County Superior Court and Darrell Dowdy versus City of Durham
08:35 that is a Middle District of North Carolina case filed in the federal court
08:38 as 23 CB 133. So moved. Second. All right we have now we will now entertain a
08:49 motion to hold a closed session at the end of the meeting and after we vote on
08:54 this one we could vote also to approve the priority items her priority items so
09:00 that motion has been made by Councilwoman Councilman Freeman
09:04 Councilman Williams, seconded by Councilwoman Freeman.
09:09 All those in favor, if you would sign by saying aye.
09:11 Aye.
09:12 All those opposed, have the same right.
09:14 Hearing none, that motion passes unanimously.
09:16 Let us also entertain a motion to accept her priority items.
09:22 The move by Councilwoman Freeman, seconded by Councilwoman Hosey-Hyman.
09:27 All those in favor, would you sign by saying aye?
09:29 Aye.
09:30 All those opposed, have the same right.
09:32 Hearing none, that motion passes.
09:33 We did come out of order, but that's okay.
09:36 Thank you very much.
09:37 Thank you.
09:37 We now turn to our clerk to see if she has
09:39 any priority items this afternoon.
09:41 Thank you very much, Madam Mayor.
09:43 I do have one item.
09:44 It is the agenda item number two,
09:47 Durham Historic Preservation Commission
09:49 mayoral appointment.
09:50 The item has been requested to be referred back
09:52 to the city clerk's office.
09:55 Thank you.
09:56 And I'll just provide a little context.
09:58 The Ms. Faye Calhoun has a term that she can fill rather
10:04 than replace her.
10:06 We did not figure that out until later on in the process
10:10 after Ms. Taborn had applied.
10:12 But Ms. Calhoun who now sits in that seat has an unexpired term
10:18 that she can fill or the next, she can, she's still eligible
10:21 to fill a second term.
10:23 Is that correct?
10:24 So we're going to refer her back in order for her
10:26 to continue in that space.
10:28 So I will now entertain a motion to accept the city clerk's priority items.
10:34 So moved.
10:35 Second.
10:36 All right, that has been moved by Councilwoman Josie Harmon, seconded by Councilwoman Freeman.
10:41 All those in favor, if you would sign by saying aye.
10:43 Aye. All those opposed, have the same right.
10:46 Hearing none, that motion passes unanimously and we will now move to the business of our agenda.
10:52 We will read the agenda in its entirety starting with our administrative consent items.

14:15 And we have several people in the audience to speak, but number 22 on the agenda is actually Ms.
14:21 Gwen Silver, who will be making comments on the public petition process.
14:25 So, city manager, we have one city manager,
14:31 deputy city manager, we have one pulled item and no presentation, and that pulled item is item nine by Mayor Pro Tem.
14:37 Is that what you have?
14:38 Yes, ma'am.
14:39 All right, we will now turn to Ms. Gwen Silver.
14:43 If she is here to speak to us in person today or on the Internet.
14:49 Do you have her listed on the Internet?
14:51 All right, Ms. Silver, you will have three minutes.
14:55 Yes. And we're ready to listen, ma'am.
14:57 We can hear you.
14:58 Okay. Good afternoon, Mayor, Council Members, City Manager, and City Administrators.
15:04 I'm Gwen Silver at 302 Sapphire Drive.
15:07 And I first want to thank Transportation Director Sean Egan for taking the time to look at street
15:13 parking in Stonehill Estates.
15:15 I have proposed some changes to the petition process so that it does not allow a rogue
15:21 management company and one disgruntled homeowner to shut down one side of the street for personal
15:27 reasons.
15:28 Let me, I know that I'm having difficulty understanding what she's saying.
15:34 Wow.
15:37 I did unmute.
15:39 We can hear you, it's just not coming in clear in here.
15:43 We did hear that part, so start again, Ms. Silver.
15:46 Okay, so I, maybe I should slow down.
15:50 I did want to thank Transportation Director Sean Egan
15:55 for time to look at street parking in Stonehill Estates. I propose some
16:01 changes to him about the petition process so that it does not allow a
16:06 rogue management company and one disgruntled homeowner to shut down one
16:13 side of the street for personal reasons. This process divided our H. O. A.
16:19 divided homeowners, divided a husband and wife,
16:24 and left residents not knowing anything
16:27 about the no parking until our June, 2023 annual meeting.
16:32 And at that annual meeting, a board member admitted
16:36 that after getting the required signatures,
16:38 she stopped sharing the petition.
16:40 The current process led to name calling,
16:44 branding people as hostile,
16:46 people lying and still lying about the process,
16:49 a request for mediation through the state of North Carolina,
16:53 hurt feelings and tears.
16:55 Here in the South, we call that a hot mess.
16:58 Some of the changes that I'm proposing
17:00 are to allow homeowners input before the process even starts.
17:05 One way to do that is to coordinate
17:07 with neighborhood improvement services
17:09 to have the community strategists coordinate the meeting
17:13 so that it's non-biased.
17:15 have the process be EMS or police driven,
17:18 rather than it being the whims of one person
17:21 who wants to close the street for personal reasons
17:24 and to require more than 50% homeowner approval
17:29 for the petition process.
17:31 Nowhere in a democratic process,
17:33 does 50% of anybody get to have the final say.
17:37 Now I understand that the process in my community
17:40 is already underway and it has to play out.
17:43 However, I'm making this request for changes
17:46 so that all of this does not happen to another community.
17:49 The new process is going to ensure that everything is fair
17:53 and that everything is equitable.
17:56 Mayor O'Neill, I know you're leaving us,
17:58 but I wanna thank you for the outstanding work
18:00 that you've done as our mayor.
18:03 You came into your own and you have served Durham well.
18:07 I wish you rest as you enter retirement again.
18:10 Thank you so much for your comments today. We will now turn to the others. We only have
18:19 one other speaker, I believe, on the Internet, so we'll go ahead and see if Ms. Jacqueline
18:25 Wagstaff can speak to us now for three minutes.
18:30 Madam Mayor, can you hear me?
18:34 Yes, we can.
18:36 Okay, good afternoon, Madam Mayor, Council Members. Glad to see that you're back at
18:43 work. Hope everybody is rested and ready to dig in and do the work that's needed
18:48 for the City of Durham and the residents. But I'm bringing to you today a concern
18:53 and it's mostly a legal concern and I'm assuming that if I publicly state my
19:00 concerned someone will get back with me about it. I would like for the attorney
19:06 to at some point provide me with documentation about ward residency for
19:16 council members. I would like to know what is the requirement of residency
19:21 status if you sit in a seat that you occupy as a ward member representing a
19:26 Ward and what would be the legal process if you no longer reside in that Ward
19:34 what would be the legal processes that has to be taken to either remove you or
19:41 address the issue because at this point there are citizens and including myself
19:47 that have some serious concerns about the residency of one of us current
19:53 seated board council member.
19:55 And we would like to know what that process is
19:59 and how soon can we get that information
20:02 so that we can take the proper step
20:05 because we believe that it is improper to hold a seat
20:09 that requires that you, the member, have to live in the ward
20:13 and to know that you don't live in the ward.
20:15 And I'm not saying that person doesn't,
20:17 but right now it is of grave concern
20:20 that we believe that person doesn't live in the ward.
20:22 And we would just like to get some clarity on it
20:25 to understand because as public officials,
20:28 this is what some of the officials up there,
20:31 I believe don't understand that
20:33 when you become a public official,
20:35 your whole life become a part of the public structure,
20:38 your social media, your residency,
20:40 especially your residency.
20:42 So if this person does not live in that ward,
20:45 we would like to start the process
20:48 of actually finding someone that can sit in that seat
20:51 actually represents that war. So I'm requesting information from the attorney
20:55 to give me clarity on what the war system requires and what the process is
21:02 if a person no longer lives in that war system and I thank you very much.
21:07 Thank you for your comments this afternoon. We will now turn to our
21:13 citizens who have joined us in person. We'll start first with Mr. Jesse
21:18 followed by Chairman O'Henson, followed by James Tavis Jr.
21:24 And Ms. Johnetta Austin in that order, and you will have three minutes apiece.
21:29 Good afternoon, Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, City Council members, City staff.
21:53 Thank you for having me.
21:54 My name is Jesse Huddleston.
21:56 My pronouns are he, she, they, we.
21:58 You can't get me wrong so long as you're being kind.
22:01 And I'm here in the role as co-chair of Pride Durham NC
22:07 that is a part of the LGBTQ Center of Durham.
22:11 The reason why I'm here is a particular request
22:15 for some support and leadership
22:19 within I think the city manager's office
22:22 to help coordinate the way in which the city
22:24 is comprehensively participating
22:27 and engaging with Pride Durham NC,
22:30 hoping that can happen with some order,
22:31 with some strategy, and with some sustainability.
22:35 For context, very quickly,
22:39 in my role as co-chair,
22:40 I've been engaging and liaising
22:42 with several different partners from within the city,
22:45 from city council all the way to folks
22:47 who are working diligently within the city's offices.
22:53 That's included folks in participatory budgeting
22:56 that I just spoke to because they knew I was here,
22:58 folks in Parks and Rec, of course we liaise
23:00 with the police for inspections,
23:03 the equity department, and the list goes on.
23:07 And it's getting to a point now where it's clear
23:10 that the city is engaged and supportive
23:13 of this program happening, it happens every year.
23:17 It's very likely that some of you might march in the parade
23:20 or that some of our city units might table in our festival.
23:24 But what feels unclear is who in place is in a position
23:30 to actually help coordinate this
23:32 so we're not missing out on the times
23:35 where people can actually connect
23:36 and we can save resources, time, money, energy.
23:40 And maybe that doesn't exist yet, right?
23:43 Historically, NC Pride was functioning until 2018.
23:47 They disbanded and then Pride Durham NC came on the scene.
23:51 Of course, by 2020, it's the pandemic.
23:53 We've gone virtual.
23:55 So it's only really been five years,
23:57 a dynamic five years at that.
23:59 And now it feels like a real opportunity
24:00 to codify local institutions like the city,
24:04 like the county that can come together
24:07 and help put this on in a way that I think
24:09 can have major economic and political implications
24:13 in the years to come.
24:15 But that takes a lot of cooperation, that takes time.
24:18 So we can cross that bridge when we get there,
24:20 but at least for now, for September 23,
24:25 Saturday, September 23rd is Prodermancy, big day.
24:30 For that day in September,
24:31 I'm hopeful that there can be some step
24:34 to meet with deputy city manager
24:37 or others in the city manager unit.
24:39 Is it communications?
24:41 I'm not sure.
24:42 But I at least wanted to transparently
24:44 bring it to all of you so that there's a clear,
24:48 There's a clear expression of that, of how much support that there is internally.
24:54 I think folks are working hard, but it's just not clear where to go for now and also where
25:00 to go for what we can plan out in the years to come.
25:05 Thank you so much.
25:07 We stand strong.
25:08 Thanks.
25:09 Another West Ender coming up.
25:12 Mr. Henson.
25:13 Good afternoon.
25:14 Good afternoon. My name is Sherman, Sherman O'Henson, and I came here today to talk about
25:22 some problems that we're having with senior affordable housing. But it's no use to talk
25:27 about the problems because we all know what the problems are. Let's talk about—I'm
25:30 going to talk about some solutions. We need a solution where these seniors who are living
25:34 in these buildings, where the companies have been given millions of dollars to take over
25:39 We need a committee or a general, some way, 24 hours, not on a recording,
25:44 because most of the seniors don't like to talk on to recording, where they can call.
25:50 24 hours, I have a problem here, my elevator is stuck, I have an appointment, I can't get there.
25:56 There's storage coming up out my bathtub, send someone to need me.
26:00 That's what we need, that's what we need.
26:02 We need a committee, and these people who we put on these chairs, make sure that they're from Durham.
26:08 Make sure they know this area.
26:10 If you were born in Watousha, Massachusetts,
26:14 there's nothing you can tell us about hay time.
26:17 And then, too, I looked at our gym every day,
26:19 all these things here.
26:20 That's nothing concerning to have a student.
26:22 OK, don't go there, Sherman.
26:24 We're to stay on set.
26:25 But anyway, we need to have those things as a solution.
26:29 Somebody needs to do this immediately.
26:31 It needs to have been done the other day.
26:33 Am I right?
26:34 Sure you're right, Sherman O'Henson,
26:36 Because these things are important.
26:39 I wasn't aware of this until I'm being evicted at the end of the month.
26:43 I have nowhere to go.
26:45 It costs to move.
26:46 It costs to transfer electricity and utilities.
26:50 And so what does senior citizens do?
26:52 Of course, the solution is, children, take care of your parents.
27:00 Mr. Chavis?
27:06 the
27:17 afternoon to you all may
27:20 the council members.
27:22 This year has been a busy year but this summer has been more
27:26 busy.
27:28 Then you do
27:29 cause lives have been flowing left and right.
27:32 since this lead has been coming out in the open.
27:39 And we, the people who is old like me know about this lead. We was at the
27:46 first meeting
27:48 with Park and Recreation and some of those then, but we haven't had another
27:53 meeting, but they put out some information last week how they're going
27:57 to do it, but they fail. We asked fail to get back in contact with us.
28:03 Then I get
28:06 the being parties. I know you're wondering why I gave you all this
28:10 information and I want you to look at it, especially the extract part,
28:16 because if you don't get a chance to look at you will have a copy. But I
28:19 want you to look at what channel the TV sound station
28:23 put out this morning.
28:28 And if you don't believe how my phone ring just being a volunteer, I invite
28:35 any y'all that get paid to come out here with me.
28:39 People call me this morning and I had some already scheduled to do and I had
28:45 to put that aside and I had to change this morning what I was going to say to
28:49 you all to prove what we've been saying. We the community folks are not the
28:56 liars.
28:57 It's a staff that y'all on
29:01 hidden in hide and put in these positions
29:06 and look at it. Look at John, they put it up and put it that way. Apart. I
29:11 circled
29:13 I suck it up for a reason. I got caught in mind. We've been saying this
29:18 over and over to the city. We know how y'all conduct some of y'all undercover
29:24 business
29:26 and how y'all get over on the community and way
29:31 just brought out to our attention that we told him that last Thursday
29:37 he went to Duke and told them
29:39 Don't y'all say nothing until we give you to come. We or I, whatever you want
29:49 to say about parking recreation, the right to put the information out to the
29:55 community. Don't you tell the community unless I or we say so. So we are puppy
30:02 on his screen, but we pay his salary.
30:08 Okay.
30:09 Now, how you think that make me feel as being black and he's
30:13 being white?
30:15 You can call me racist.
30:17 I don't care.
30:18 I've been called more than that this week.
30:22 Okay, but I'm not going to be afraid to continue to stand up
30:26 to y'all and ask y'all.
30:29 Those who want to come say to the meeting fine.
30:31 Thank you, Mr. Chavis.
30:33 All right, but please do something about this, because this is not the end, it's just the beginning.
31:01 Good afternoon.
31:19 Mayor O'Neill, Mayor Pro Tem Middleton, and the rest of the council persons.
31:27 My name is Johnnetta Austin.
31:30 I reside at 4900 North Roxbury apartment 319 better known as the JFK towers.
31:47 That no longer is a picture of JFK hanging in the lobby.
31:54 I guess it was a disrespect to have him in such a nasty place.
32:03 No one should be living in that JFK Towers.
32:08 It's a senior disabled living space, one bedroom apartments.
32:17 I'm going to think there's about 60% of the residents that live there do not have air.
32:23 They give you one box fan when you tell them your air is out.
32:30 My air isn't out, but the water from the air
32:35 is backing up into my apartment onto the carpet
32:38 that the carpet is soaking wet.
32:41 There's about two inches of mold sitting
32:44 on the floor on the carpet, on top of the carpet at back.
32:50 I have health issues.
32:52 I guess I had to say that part.
32:57 On behalf of that community,
32:59 Millennium Housing out of Ohio,
33:02 are the owners of this building.
33:06 Durham Housing Authority gave this company back in 2019,
33:12 $19 million to rehab it when the troubleshooter went out,
33:17 shooter went out when when Global Foundation owned the building. Millennium
33:28 purchased it from them along with all of the the problems that was going on then.
33:35 Problems such as the elevators don't work, it's three elevators. At all times
33:40 maybe one might work. The water system is bad. I got a note here on my door
33:47 yesterday that says they're turning the water off on Friday July the 21st for
33:53 several hours. This is this is on a weekly basis. This is not just for
33:59 tomorrow. This is on a weekly basis. We go without water period. Look don't matter
34:06 what your problem is don't matter if you need water to flush it don't matter you
34:11 not gonna have water because they don't turn it off in the whole building do the
34:14 best you can and trash we have trash chutes on every floor they're always
34:23 blocked so the older people who do the best they can to get around take it to
34:29 the chute can't get it in there throw it outside the door but the last thing you
34:36 have to do something. We're the ones that the community used. You stood on our
34:43 backs to get where you are today.
34:47 So therefore, you should send everybody out there to get it right, because
34:53 obviously this company does not care. And I live with my daughter now, but
35:00 I'm not moving until it's right. Thank you, Miss Alston.
35:06 Thank you.
35:12 We now turn to item number nine, which I believe was pulled by,
35:18 well, which I know was pulled by Mayor Pro Tem. Mayor Pro Tem,
35:21 and item nine.
35:23 Thank you, Your Honor.
35:24 Madam Mayor, I'm sorry to interrupt. There's one speaker
35:26 on the virtual queue with his hand up.
35:29 Okay, if you will go ahead and call that person to the
35:32 forefront.
35:36 Hello. Yes, we can hear you Mr. Robinson. Yeah, good afternoon, Mayor Pro, Mayor, Judge
35:48 O'Neill. First, let me say this, I haven't had a chance to do this. Congratulations on
35:55 heeding the call to be Mayor of Durham. This is another first for you, first female judge
36:01 to be elected to Superior Court in Durham County, then the first female mayor to be
36:07 mayor of Durham.
36:09 And I think it's the greatest thing to ever happen to Durham.
36:15 What my issue was, my question was, the issue about the investigation of City Council, has
36:24 that been concluded or is it ongoing?
36:29 I believe it is ongoing, Mr. Robeson,
36:31 although I should not be interrupting you,
36:34 but I noticed you paused,
36:36 so I will tell you that it is ongoing from my understanding.
36:41 Okay, great.
36:44 My other thing is, the firemen's pay.
36:49 When I saw they make $14 an hour
36:54 as an individual that responds to the call for help,
36:59 I just couldn't believe it.
37:01 I'm working at McDonald's.
37:03 I make 17.
37:05 So I'm saying to myself, why would they even
37:09 deny them tier pay?
37:12 I mean, I'm just curious.
37:16 What provoked them not to give them their legitimate pay?
37:24 Those four.
37:25 I just called to complain, that's all.
37:33 Thank you Mr. Robeson.
37:35 Appreciate your calling in.
37:36 You have a great day.
37:39 You too.
37:42 Is there anyone else online that would like to be heard at this time?
37:48 I think I've gone through all of the cards so we will now turn back to Mayor Pro Tem
37:54 for pull item number nine, which is an amendment to the contract with the FMRT
38:00 group LLC for the provision of police psychological services for the City of
38:04 Durham Police Department. Mayor Pro Tem. Thank you Madam Mayor. Good afternoon
38:09 Madam Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, City Council, David Anthony, Assistant Chief
38:13 Administrative Services Bureau. I'm here to answer your questions. Assistant Chief
38:18 thank you so much for being here it's good to see you and as always we are
38:20 incredibly grateful for you and the entire command staff and all of the men
38:24 and women under your command that hold a line for us
38:27 every day.
38:28 I had a question about the psychological services, which
38:33 is a profoundly good thing that we have this
38:36 available for our officers.
38:40 And let me preface this by saying
38:41 I'm sure my questions are more about my level
38:46 of comprehension rather than the clarity of the memo, which
38:48 is often the case with me.
38:50 But there's a line in the memo, it says in July 2022,
38:56 the city and the FMRT group executed a contract
38:58 for the delivery of psychological services
39:00 for members of the Durham Police Department.
39:01 And we know this is not a new thing,
39:03 but it says this included evaluations
39:05 for members of specific teams within the department.
39:10 Are our patrol officers required to go through evaluations
39:14 or is this a service that's available upon demand
39:18 or are you referred to it by a command,
39:21 a member of the command staff?
39:22 Could you explain to us how it's integrated
39:24 into our operations at the department?
39:27 Yes, sir.
39:27 That's a great question.
39:28 So, the FMRT, we have a contract for FMRT
39:31 that does provide testing and psychological services at will
39:37 for officers and employees that do seek that.
39:39 However, we do have certain circumstances
39:41 to where there are things that we mandate.
39:44 A critical incident that had occurred, would occur,
39:47 we would then send the employees after that critical incident,
39:50 fit for duties, those type of things.
39:52 So they are all able to access those resources,
39:54 which is what that contract initially is for.
39:58 However, we do have certain units within the department
40:02 that we do, based upon the nature of their duties,
40:04 we mandate that they do, I think it's semi-annual
40:09 or quarterly training, and due to the nature of that,
40:12 they go, they have to participate in these services.
40:16 The reason for the increase is based upon our recent reorganization, we have added more
40:21 staff into those units, so we have increased our homicide units.
40:25 We've also taken on the victim services units from community safety, so that now we are
40:30 putting them in there due to the nature of how they're working side by side.
40:33 So it is an increase of the personnel that we are mandating to go to those.
40:38 Thank you so much, Philip.
40:39 And that kind of anticipated my next question, because as I read the memo, it was a line
40:43 of talked about the employees assigned to these units may be exposed to work
40:48 stressors beyond that of other employees which you know I don't know if that's SWAT
40:52 or whatever, but I was wondering was there some type of
40:56 critical incident or self-reporting that occasioned this increase but to hear you
41:03 it's just we got more people so we need more money. Yes sir and it's it's
41:08 available any of the they are mandated to do it because of their position
41:11 because we understand the stressors they go through,
41:14 so we want to make sure that they get any information
41:17 they're able to decompress through that as necessary.
41:20 What this has done is just because we have added
41:21 more people into those units,
41:24 so that we want them to participate
41:26 in those services as well.
41:28 Got you.
41:28 Now that clears up what I had to ask.
41:32 Thank you again so much, good to see you.
41:34 Yes sir, good to see you.
41:35 Thank you, your honor, I yield back.
41:37 Thank you so much, thank you.
41:39 Thank you.
41:40 For being here today.
41:40 All right, I think we are now,
41:43 we have no presentations this afternoon,
41:45 so we are now at our board and commissions report
41:51 from our clerk.
42:00 Thank you, Madam Mayor.
42:02 I would start with the item number two was referred back.
42:07 That was the mayoral appointment
42:09 on the Historic Preservation Committee.
42:11 The Durham Affordable Housing
42:13 Implementation Committee appointment is Glenda Ange.
42:20 The two appointments, or I'm sorry, the nominations,
42:23 the two nominations to the Durham Affordable Housing
42:25 Implementation Committee Mayoral Appointments
42:27 are Courtney James and Prince R. Rivers.
42:32 And then for the final nomination,
42:36 the Durham Open Space and Trails Commission,
42:38 There was not consensus.
42:41 Three council members had selected Connor M. Chappell
42:45 and the other three council members
42:47 had requested re-advertisement of the position.
42:50 And Council Member Johnson has not voted
42:52 because she's not in attendance today.
42:55 I didn't know how you wanted to proceed.
43:02 The open space, I think we have one.
43:04 Open Space and Trails Commission.
43:06 Had that been re-advertised?
43:08 I noticed we just had the one person,
43:10 but I'm not sure whether it had been re-advertised
43:12 a number of times.
43:14 I would have to check on that.
43:21 Hi, good afternoon, Madam Mayor, Mayor O'Neill,
43:25 members of city council, Lola Rowland here
43:27 with the city clerk's office.
43:28 I can answer that quick question.
43:31 There was a previous appointment made to fill that seat
43:34 by Mr. Steven Cohn, that council had previously nominated,
43:37 but he resigned because he actually took a county seat
43:41 and filled the county category on that.
43:43 So I had to re-advertise that seat.
43:46 So it's technically only been re-advertised once so far.
43:51 Madam Mayor, Madam Clerk, I'm fine with flipping.
43:54 I think I voted for the applicant
43:56 and I'm fine with re-advertising.
43:59 Thank you.
44:00 We have four votes to re-advertise that position.
44:02 Thank you.
44:04 Thank you, Council Member Javier.
44:06 We now turn to settle our agenda.
44:13 I turn it to Deputy City Manager Johnson.
44:18 Madam Mayor, I have items one and three
44:21 through 15 on consent and GBA public hearings,
44:25 items 16 through 21.
44:27 Thank you, I'd like to entertain a motion
44:29 to settle the agenda.
44:30 Move.
44:31 Second.
44:32 moved by Councilman Freeman, Councilman Williams, seconded by Councilwoman Freeman.
44:39 All right all those in favor sign by saying aye. All those opposed have the
44:45 same right. Hearing none our agenda is settled. Now are there any other items to
44:51 come before the council before we adjourn to go into closed session? All
44:58 All right, hearing none, we will adjourn at 143 on 720-2023.
45:06 Bull City Strong, shout out to the Watkins Family Circle Reunion.
45:11 Here in Durham, North Carolina for 51 years.
45:15 All right.
