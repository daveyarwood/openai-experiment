02:54 Good afternoon, ma'am.
02:55 Good afternoon, my honorable colleagues, everyone in the chamber.
02:57 Madam Mayor, last night I was a bit late to the meeting because I was celebrating with
03:00 our colleagues and friends at the county who are about to launch the county's iteration
03:05 of guaranteed income.
03:06 This is a movement that is gaining much steam around the country, and indeed we're very
03:11 proud here in Durham to be receiving national attention for our participation.
03:15 A wonderful film called It's Basic was screened by the county as part of their celebration.
03:20 So I just want to send congratulations out to our colleagues at the county and
03:25 really excited about the residents who will be participating.
03:28 Talking about this time of year when so many of us will be engaged in feasting,
03:34 having guaranteed income for our neighbors and our friends.
03:37 Suggesting that there's a line by virtue of your citizenship and humanity that we will not allow you to fall beneath as a nation.
03:43 it's an appropriate time of year to be celebrating a guaranteed income. So
03:46 congratulations to our friends at the county and thank my colleagues for
03:49 allowing me to participate on behalf of the city to talk about our experiences
03:53 with a guaranteed income. And finally just a blessed and joyous and restful
03:58 holiday season to you colleagues and to all of the residents and citizens of our
04:02 city. Thank you ma'am. Councilman Williams. Briefly, thank you
04:07 Madam Mayor and colleagues. Last night I talked about a $300,000
04:10 appropriation for the Heron Rookery that our delegation was able to work out for
04:17 us here in Durham out of Raleigh and what I mean by delegation our
04:20 representatives and senators at the state level. I failed to mention the
04:25 organization that really put the work in to make this happen and that is the
04:28 Ellerbe Creek Watershed Association so I just wanted to shout them out.
04:33 I thought about it all last night that I didn't even mention their name so thank you.
04:37 Thank you.
04:39 All right, let us proceed now to recognize our city manager who is back with us today after I hope was a great weekend with her family.
04:47 She was a bridesmaid in the wedding over the weekend.
04:52 And I know you had a fantastic time, so welcome back.
04:57 Thank you, thank you, ma'am.
04:59 Thank you, Madam Mayor, Mr. Mayor Pro Tem and members of the Durham City Council.
05:05 The city manager's office has no priority items today.

05:16 in today for attorney Kim Rayburg.
05:20 Welcome to the dais.
05:21 Thank you, Madam Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem and members of the city council.
05:25 The city attorney's office does not have any priority items today.
05:29 And we'll turn back to Paola, did I pronounce it correctly?
05:36 Paola Rowland, who's standing in today
05:38 for our city clerk, Donna Schreiber.
05:41 Good afternoon.
05:43 Good afternoon, Madam Mayor, Mr. Mayor Pro Tem,

10:49 Is that what you have as well?
10:52 All righty.
10:53 Okay, we have a couple of speakers who are here with us today in person, and then we have one person on the internet as well.
11:03 The first person that I have who will speak to us is Mr. Jeremy Bergeron,
11:08 and that will be followed by Mr. Russell Pierce, and then we'll turn to the internet for Ms. Jacqueline Wagstaff.
11:15 And each of you will have three minutes a piece.
11:17 Thank you for being here today.
11:19 Go ahead, Mayor O'Neill.
11:24 Just state your name and you have three minutes.
11:26 My name is Jeremy Berger and I live at 112 East Piedmont Avenue.
11:31 I'm just coming here today.
11:33 I don't like coming out just to say I'm not wearing sunglasses because I'm trying to look cool.
11:36 I'm just trying to not have a panic attack, you feel me?
11:39 And I'm a person with disabilities.
11:43 I know this is y'all's last day up here, some of y'all.
11:46 And I recently had the chance to see a therapist that had helped me out like ten years ago.
11:52 And so I want to come out and say thank you.
11:58 In the same way that I would thank a therapist for helping me get through a time, okay?
12:03 I want to say thank you for being a political social worker to poor people,
12:10 people living in section 8 housing, people living in veterans housing,
12:15 people that have experienced gun violence,
12:18 people that are veterans, I want to thank you.
12:24 I want to thank you, Mayor O'Neill.
12:26 I know I threw some word grenades in some city stuff,
12:29 you know, and...
12:34 I traced witnessing some gun violence in 2016.
12:38 I traced what got me to come out recently.
12:42 I traced it, and it was you.
12:46 Okay?
12:48 So I don't wanna come out, you know what I'm saying?
12:50 When you get impacted by all that,
12:53 the people that hold you up when the government
12:55 doesn't hold you up is women.
12:57 Okay, it's women, and then you like burn through these women.
13:01 And we burned through these women this last few years, man.
13:03 We burned through these women.
13:06 You know, and this woman brought up Esther last night.
13:13 You feel me?
13:14 That's serious.
13:15 Not talking about no Christian God, talking about God of everybody.
13:20 You know what I'm saying?
13:21 I'm poor.
13:23 I'm disabled.
13:25 I've been watching these city council meetings and going, what's going on saying the same thing?
13:30 Councilwoman Freeman's been saying under my breath.
13:33 thinking I was wrong and I might still be wrong, you feel me?
13:39 So I thank you.
13:42 I thank you for carrying these burdens on people.
13:46 None of these people would have spoke up if it wasn't for you.
13:49 We wouldn't have heard none of these people.
13:51 And then I realized I was a child of God, you feel me?
13:55 I didn't ever think I would ever have a mayor like this.
13:59 Come on now.
14:03 I'm so glad that I live in the time when Mayor O'Neill was my mayor.
14:10 The only access I have is three minutes in a council meeting.
14:14 I'm going to take that.
14:17 Last day, man, rain, I could have not come up here and say thank you.
14:23 Yo, and last night, last night, this vet was used up here, and I'm not trying to yap at
14:31 y'all. But this vet came up here from the VA and I've been used a long time ago. I've
14:35 been used, man. Me and my homies been used. And we need to find out that developer and
14:41 y'all who voted for SCAD especially. I'm begging y'all, if y'all care about it, y'all need
14:48 to hit that developer up. Get that vet's contact and hit him up and say, hey, I'm sorry we
14:54 use you, what's your cash app, what's your favorite restaurant?
14:56 Peace, peace.
14:58 Mr. Russell Pierce, and then we have two more folks who have joined us that would like to
15:09 speak, Gideon Bueno and Chris Benjamin, and then we'll turn to the internet.
15:16 Good afternoon, Mayor O'Neill, Mayor Pro Tem Middleton, members of council, Manager Page,
15:20 and if I can include Manager Page's team on this today.
15:24 Many times we come and ask for things to be done or fixed or changed in some way,
15:28 and I've had my share of those moments with you all and with the county this year.
15:32 But today, I wanted to come and just say thank you.
15:35 In August, with 3 million in support from you and a matching amount from Durham County,
15:39 we were able to purchase and preserve Carver Creek Apartments.
15:42 Not only did we save the 48 units of affordable housing, but
15:45 we've opened the door to creating a supportive housing campus with deeply integrated services.
15:50 Already a team has begun to work to determine the right mixture of services for the campus.
15:54 They'll soon be surveying current residents and understand what they would like to see on site.
15:58 We'll then move into a facilitated process with partners who are interested
16:01 in being and operating on the campus.
16:04 As that work is completed, we'll run into a master planning process
16:08 for the entire 11-1⁄2-acre campus.
16:10 We originally had hoped to have a ribbon cutting but came to realize
16:13 that would be too invasive for the residents during this time of transition.
16:16 I've had the opportunity to meet with many of them and have been amazed by their stories.
16:21 I think we all knew that part of our effort was to ensure folks would not be displaced
16:25 from their homes.
16:26 What many of us didn't know was that we were making sure they weren't experiencing a second
16:30 displacement.
16:31 I've heard over and over again from residents of Carver Creek about their experience renting
16:36 homes in Durham, homes being sold, the people who bought them wanted to live in them or
16:40 raised the rent to the point they couldn't stay, and even as seniors experiencing homelessness,
16:45 and then Carver Creek became their home.
16:47 It's been an amazing thing to hear those kinds of stories
16:51 because that's beyond even what we expected.
16:53 Another resident told me she'd been watching the news
16:55 for months and joked about how much we'd been on the news.
16:58 And then she said, I just want everyone to know
17:00 how grateful I am that they pulled off this miracle
17:02 because I know a lot of work was put into this
17:04 by a lot of people in a really short amount of time.
17:07 People are truly amazed at how we as a community
17:08 pulled this off in record time.
17:10 And I really do want to thank you for your leadership
17:13 and also for the work that Manager Page
17:15 team did. They were equal parts brilliant and patient with us as we move through
17:19 this really quickly. I'm often asked how we got this started and for a while I
17:23 talked about the date of the property going up for sale. I don't think that's
17:27 correct though. I believe it started in the library auditorium on a dreary rainy
17:31 night last January when we gathered for the annual point-in-time count. Several
17:35 of you were with us that night. I remember Mayor that you and Chair
17:38 Howerton went out as a team. You were the very last team to come back because you
17:43 We took such good care and time in talking with our most vulnerable neighbors.
17:47 That night more than 120 people from the community went out, not just to count our unsheltered neighbors, but to learn from them.
17:53 And what we learned that night created a sense of urgency to work together as a community to ensure our most vulnerable neighbors can have access to safe,
18:00 affordable housing and the services they'll need to remain housed.
18:02 So just today, thank you again for all of that.
18:06 And we look forward to partnering in new ways, especially as we begin planning now for the 2024 point in time count.
18:12 But especially Manager Page, your team, we really appreciate all their work and the leadership
18:18 from the council.
18:20 Thank you so much for coming by.
18:22 Mr. Gideon Bueno.
18:25 Good afternoon, everybody.
18:32 I just wanted to say first thank you for your public service.
18:36 I didn't realize that this would be like the last meeting for some of you.
18:40 So I just wanted to say thank you for, I guess, all of your work and all of, like, the unseen
18:47 work that goes into showing up as your best self every day.
18:49 So much appreciated.
18:52 I also want to thank the first person that spoke.
18:55 I just was really impacted by their words.
18:58 So I'm feeling a little emotional.
18:59 My emotions are very much on my sleeve right now.
19:04 Anyway, so I've spoken at a couple of these city council meetings about wheels,
19:12 and I know that today that y'all are going to be discussing sort of like the budget,
19:17 and also I guess moving forward with a certain contractor to up the space,
19:21 to not only bring it up to ADA compliance, but also to,
19:27 I guess, finalize some interior design things about it.
19:33 So one of the things that I wanted to say is that,
19:38 you know, I have been skating for a long time
19:40 in this community and specifically
19:43 with Bull City Roller Derby.
19:46 And one of the things that I learned
19:48 at the last residence committee meeting
19:51 is that the final design for this space
19:54 will reduce the skating area.
19:58 And it's my understanding that it is final
20:02 and I just wanted to express while I had some time
20:06 that if there's any opportunity to prioritize
20:12 like the activity that's like really limited
20:15 to this space, right?
20:16 Like there aren't a lot of skating surfaces,
20:19 indoor skating surfaces in this area
20:22 and that does have an impact on the community
20:25 that like relies on these spaces.
20:29 So I just wanted to put it out there that like,
20:32 And when we run our practices, we
20:33 would be able to have concurrent beginners skating practices,
20:38 and then also intermediate advanced practices
20:41 with the full rink.
20:43 And I know that this space is going
20:44 to be servicing multiple leagues.
20:47 And so being able to run double practices
20:49 is actually really helpful, especially when there's just
20:52 limited space and areas for us to play the sport.
20:57 And I guess I do want to say that I'm also very excited
21:01 that we're moving forward with this project.
21:03 And I'm very excited to see the end result
21:06 and that it's gonna be hopefully within a year
21:09 where we can skate indoors again.
21:12 But yeah, thank you so much for again,
21:17 yeah, your service to the city.
21:19 And I look forward to hearing more
21:22 about updates on this project.
21:25 Thank you.
21:26 Thank you so much.
21:28 Mr. Chris Benjamin.
21:31 Good afternoon to everybody, back again.
21:45 And we brought just part of our team because we're still working.
21:51 And we just got some farewell items that we're going to leave the mayor.
22:01 Hey, here, take this.
22:03 She needs to read this card out.
22:05 All right.
22:06 You can come on down.
22:07 Yeah.
22:08 Thank you.
22:09 Yeah.
22:10 Oh, shit.
22:11 Yeah.
22:12 Oh, shoot.
22:13 Sorry.
22:44 Thank you.
22:45 We just want to let you know we're coming from a different place of gratitude and love
22:51 Thank you.
22:52 I need you to read that, I'll walk away.
22:53 Okay.
22:54 Thank you.
22:55 This is for you.
22:56 Thank you for everything you've done and what you're doing.
22:57 I need you to read that and I'll walk away.
22:58 Thank you.
22:59 Okay.
23:00 I have a letter for you.
23:01 This is from Dr. Veale.
23:02 Thank you.
23:03 This is for you.
23:04 Thank you.
23:05 This is for you.
23:06 Thank you.
23:08 And we just want to let you know we're coming from a different place of gratitude and love and respect.
23:15 Thank you for everything you've done and what you're doing.
23:18 But I need you to read that and walk away.
23:20 Okay.
23:21 Okay.
23:27 Happy Thanksgiving and happy holidays.
23:30 We're leaving you here with a farewell card from us.
23:35 We want to thank the Mayor Elaine for spending time and talking with us as a
23:40 solid waste department. We're here to let you know that what you've done
23:45 hasn't been forgotten and we're here to let you know that your efforts were
23:50 recognized. As you exit out of your current position and start a new chapter
23:55 in your life, we're here to support and respect your life decisions. As you close
24:01 this chapter and begin another chapter. As life challenges come, the time you've
24:07 spent as the mayor has been on a new horizon for yourself as well as for the
24:12 whole city. Life has challenged you as you have challenged us. Thank you for
24:17 allowing us to build and come together in solidarity because had it not been
24:23 for you and the ones that you work that work with you in our favor we would have
24:28 have never come together in solidarity.
24:32 Having this short period of time, we've grown as a city community and as a solid waste department.
24:38 So once again, Bull City Pride, Bull City Ride,
24:43 Durham's Dermot Finest, Elaine O'Neill carrying a torch to her new beginning and new chapter.
24:51 We thank you sincerely from the solid waste department.
24:55 God bless you and continue to watch over you as you move forward in your next
25:00 chapter of life. So beautiful.
25:16 I think Jack is okay.
25:23 Madam Clerk is Miss Wax half available.
25:25 All right.
25:28 Ms. Wagstaff, if you can hear me,
25:29 good afternoon and welcome.
25:30 You'll have three minutes.
25:34 Can you hear me, Madam Mayor?
25:36 Her honor's not at the podium yet.
25:37 I can hear you.
25:38 Please proceed.
25:39 You have three minutes.
25:40 I'm here.
25:41 You can go ahead.
25:42 Madam Mayor, just one observation.
25:46 On this Zoom, and it actually has frozen,
25:48 so all we're looking at is just a caption
25:50 of the Mayor Pro Tem, and it's nothing.
25:53 We can hear everything that's going on,
25:55 but there's no visual.
25:56 The screen has frozen for the Zoom link of this meeting.
26:00 But now I got that out of the way.
26:04 Again, I just wanna say, Madam Mayor,
26:09 I thank you from the bottom of my heart
26:13 for just being the mayor, agreeing to be the mayor,
26:16 because we got to actually see
26:18 what a true public servant looks like
26:20 and how they operate.
26:22 And you have been that throughout this whole experience
26:26 that you have experienced.
26:28 Even though a lot of us are sad that you are leaving,
26:31 I truly understand that, you know,
26:34 life has different direction towards us.
26:37 And I know that you're going in a different direction,
26:39 but we'll always be here to support you.
26:41 I know I will.
26:43 I'll never, I've never experienced a mayor like you
26:46 in all the years of my living in Durham
26:48 and even being involved in the politics of Durham.
26:51 you are one in a million, so I just want to thank you.
26:54 And if Monique Hyman is here,
26:57 I just want to say getting to know you
26:59 and you being on that diocese for the short amount of time,
27:03 you've made some great impacts
27:04 and there are people out here
27:05 that will continue to stand with you.
27:07 But I also want to address the fact
27:09 that I know there's a presentation going to be done
27:13 about the crime and we know crime is rising
27:15 and I watched the media this morning
27:19 And they talked about that where the murder rate has increased by 9%.
27:25 Rapes have increased by 21 point something percent.
27:29 And honestly, based on that vote that was taken last night, we haven't seen anything
27:35 yet in Durham.
27:36 We think that crime is going to go down.
27:39 It's not going to go down.
27:40 There are going to be more people that are going to be housing insecure.
27:44 They're going to be more people on these streets.
27:46 And when people become housing insecure, unfortunately, some of these elements of crimes creep into
27:52 their lives. And that's what we're going to have to deal with. And that's going to be
27:56 on—that blood is on the hands of those four votes last night that raised their hand to
28:01 move forward in an effort that went against the general public. The public stated their
28:07 objection to it, and the people that voted for it didn't listen to the public. They
28:13 felt like developers were more important than the people,
28:18 the citizens of Durham.
28:19 And as I've said, elections do have consequences.
28:24 And this election has given us some consequences.
28:27 And this is for the mayor-elect.
28:29 I hope that you do, and this is my hope,
28:32 that you do a much better job when you take over that diocese
28:36 as the mayor than you have done, that you
28:38 have done for us in Ward 3.
28:41 So I'm hoping and I pray that you actually listen to people
28:45 and you actually do the job that you're supposed to do
28:48 and not do the public's development for you.
28:51 Thank you, Madam Chair.
28:52 Thank you.
28:54 Thank you so much.
28:57 Did you want to sign up to speak at the citizens?
29:00 All right.
29:01 And then you fill out the card afterwards, Mr. Garrett.
29:06 And then we will turn to our third quarter crime report
29:10 we have no port items today. So I'm really here to talk about the Bloomberg
29:14 but hearing that crime report right first I want to say thank everybody for
29:18 what you do and what you're gonna do. However, this crime... Mr. Garrett, if you'll
29:24 suspend for a second. Madam Clerk, the clock is... And we're gonna you're gonna
29:28 have your prison your entire presentation on Bloomberg right after we
29:31 do the crime report. Yes ma'am. Okay. Okay so I'm here really to talk about the
29:36 Bloomberg. However, I'm one of those guys that the J. I talking about the
29:40 crime like I'm willing to work with anybody pertaining to crime when like
29:45 the stop the violence, the intervention and prevention. My concern is like
29:49 this. This a holiday coming up right in them. Kids out there is starving and
29:54 they trying to figure out no other way except how to eat. So what I'm asking
29:58 this team to do is to is the is the build on what the mayor has set aside.
30:05 The mayor has put some plans together and because she's walking away,
30:10 don't mean the plan can't stay.
30:12 So what I want to do is invite myself into your world and invite you into my world
30:19 because the streets don't stand up in here.
30:22 The streets are out there.
30:24 But I'm willing to intervene between the streets and in here,
30:28 but y'all got to allow me to.
30:30 What we got to do is take personalities out of the way and put the principle in.
30:34 principle is we want to stop these kids from dying and we got to quit worrying
30:38 about the personalities and we got to say, Okay, this is really what I want to
30:41 do for my city. I love my city that you know, if you really want to serve Durham
30:47 like them kids out there killing each other man, like what can we do to stop
30:51 the violence? You know, we could talk a good game and I could stand there for
30:54 three minutes and tell you all what's happening. But what I'm saying is like
30:57 the crime rate is going up. The crime rate is going up. The crime rate is
31:02 going up. What are we willing to do about it? Monique, I've heard some
31:06 wonderful things about you. My name is Dennis. I am willing to sit down and
31:10 talk to you. I really want to talk to you, Mayor up and coming. Mark, I want
31:15 to talk to you guys. City manager. Thank you for the opportunity. But I
31:17 really want to say Mayor O'Neill, thank you for everything you have done from
31:21 the time you walked into this gate and I know you ain't walking out the gate.
31:25 You know, I know that I know that and I'm here for you like I support you.
31:30 You know, Deidre Arna has done some wonderful things in our community, but what we're missing
31:34 is the collaboration of working together, man. We all sit amongst each other, but we got to
31:39 work together because people still dying. You know, crime is still going on. So what are we
31:44 really willing to do about it? Every one of y'all can have my number, and I promise you,
31:49 them streets I know. I promise you that. Thank you, Mr. Garrett.
31:54 At this time, we'll turn to our first presentation on crime, 2023 Third Quarter Crime Report.
32:06 As our chief makes her way on her crutches.
32:11 Chief, you stand on crutches, huh?
32:14 She always looks so good.
32:18 You have on heels today?
32:20 time I saw you, you had on heels with the crutches.
32:26 I was pre-op then.
32:28 All right.
32:30 We glad you're here today, Chief.
32:31 I am, thank you.
32:32 Been a pleasure.
32:36 My tablet, my legal pad.
32:43 Yeah, that's one.
32:45 And a pen, there's a pen in there.
32:48 Thank you.
33:11 Takes a little bit for me to get situated now, so bear with me.
33:15 Good afternoon, Madam Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, City of Durham Council, Manager Page, City
33:23 Leadership, my officers that are in attendance and that are listening as well as my staff,
33:31 Durham Police Department and our community. I am bringing you today the third quarter
33:37 crime report as I always do each quarter. As you know, this particular report is a report
33:45 This report covers five measures, part one violent crime and part one property crime,
33:51 our clearance rates, response times.
33:54 We have kind of tweaked this report just a little bit to reflect some different information that we think would be a little more helpful for you and our staffing levels.
34:07 So this is what our crime looks like now for our part one violent crimes.
34:13 And as you can see, we were up in two categories and down in two.
34:19 Homicide and rape, we saw increases, as you all know,
34:23 as you all have been watching the news and probably keeping track for yourself.
34:28 We're up 9%, 9.4% in homicide and rape, 21.6%.
34:36 For the last few quarters, we have been up in rape in the cases that have been reported.
34:41 Many of them are cases that have occurred or belated cases from previous years.
34:47 Our robbery has come down.
34:49 21.3% is certainly not an insignificant number.
34:54 Staff has been doing a fantastic job with trying to identify and apprehend groups of
35:00 individuals, juveniles, and a sprinkling of adults that have been committing a lot of
35:06 our robbery trends, including robberies against our Hispanic and Latino community, and aggravated
35:14 assault saw a slight decrease. Overall, we are about 5.5 percent down in violent crime.
35:22 So as of November 20th, we are at 45 homicides. We are on task to, obviously, and we have
35:30 have surpassed where we were last year.
35:35 And this number actually includes one negligent manslaughter, but it doesn't include the two
35:41 justifiable homicides that we did have to date as of November 20th.
35:47 As I said earlier, our rape was up.
35:50 We had 118 actual forcible rape offenses, which is different from what's reported.
35:58 34 percent of the reported offenses occurred in prior years.
36:02 So we're seeing more as we have been more belated sexual assault and rapes being reported.
36:10 And 15 of our 28 clearances were reported in prior years.
36:14 And this is significant to have 15 of the 28 clearances having been reported from prior years.
36:22 because, as we know, the likelihood of solvability for cold case or belated sexual assaults and
36:30 rapes, the likelihood of actually being able to identify an offender decreases as time
36:35 goes along.
36:37 So I do want to hold up and uplift my team of investigators working with cold case cases
36:44 as well as our forensics teams that have worked so hard to bring these offenders to justice.
36:52 to take a small celebration for our robberies being down. I mean, that's also significant.
36:57 When we talk about robberies and violent crimes against people, oftentimes those are some
37:02 of the hardest crimes to actually solve and also prevent, right? So 75 percent of our
37:11 robberies were from persons. So that's down 20 percent from this time last quarter.
37:19 Forty two percent of our robberies from persons had one or more Hispanic victims.
37:23 So as you've seen on the news we've we've we've worked very hard to to notify our our general population but also our residents that are most affected by these crimes where our Hispanic and Latino community have been specifically targeted because of them leaving.
37:44 So when they leave stores and places of business, they are being followed.
37:49 And they're being targeted because of the likelihood that they have money on them.
37:54 And staff has worked very hard to try and really enhance our community outreach.
38:02 Many of you know Officer Avila.
38:04 She spoke PENM Construction.
38:06 We worked closely with PENM to organize a community outreach and
38:10 safety event in which she was able to to come in and speak to some of our community members that were present.
38:18 But that is just a small portion of the work that it's being done around social media engagement and in outreach regarding these
38:27 crimes.
38:31 So I'll move forward to our our shooting incidents.
38:34 So we are up in shooting incidents and I know this without necessarily having to look at the at the numbers themselves because I get an alert every time we have a shooting and I read the watch reports and I can I know when we have one shooting when another one is happening and my officers are having to run from one end of the city to the other and and really work to address these crimes.
39:00 We are up 17.2 percent.
39:03 That is staggering compared to this same time last year.
39:10 However, the persons that have been shot in these are down 22.4 percent,
39:15 with 3 percent of those being fatal.
39:17 And then we had obviously 26.5 percent reduction in that we saw that were non-fatal.
39:25 So, of the 676 shooting incidents, 77 of those were initiated by a ShotSpotter alert with
39:34 no corresponding 911 call being received.
39:38 We want to start to talk about ShotSpotter as we prepare for at some point providing
39:44 a presentation to council at the end, the full end of our pilot program.
39:50 Some firearms incidents accounted for about 34 percent of all aggravated assaults.
39:56 So we're having more victims in these incidents of aggravated assaults.
40:03 And as you know, our target is less than 30 percent.
40:07 We had 837 guns that were seized in 624 incidents.
40:15 That doesn't add up, right?
40:16 So that means that there's multiple guns at these incidents.
40:19 And I did not pull the numbers, but I believe that we are seizing more now in these incidents
40:26 through the third quarter.
40:28 And that means significantly that we were up 15 percent over year to year.
40:37 So property crime.
40:39 We are going into the holiday season, and we are up, up, up going into this holiday
40:44 season.
40:45 crimes are one of those crimes that can potentially be preventable.
40:53 We have to really learn how as community members, as the public, to harden ourselves against
41:00 property crime, to make it very hard for those criminals to want to break into our vehicles
41:08 or break into our homes or even steal our motor vehicles.
41:14 And so as a result, burglaries were up 15 percent, 15.6 percent.
41:21 Larcenies up.
41:22 So those are our shopliftings and our larcenies from motor vehicles.
41:27 156 percent increase in motor vehicle theft.
41:30 I understand it's a nationwide trend.
41:33 We are making arrests of rings of juveniles and unfortunately, you know, when one group
41:42 is arrested, another group pops up.
41:47 So of the burglary offenses, as you see, we had 1,066 burglary offenses.
41:52 Sixty-one percent of those were from homes, from residential locations.
41:58 Fifteen percent of those were from retail business locations.
42:01 So tools, EZs, that's what they're trying to find is tools, is construction tools, anything
42:08 that most likely you aren't going to have a VIN number for,
42:11 or not a VIN number because that would be a car,
42:13 but most likely you're not going to have a serial number for,
42:16 and like I did the other day, you just take it out of the box
42:20 and you put it up and it's trash,
42:21 everything else is trash, I don't record anything.
42:23 So I want to just, you know, for community members,
42:26 please make sure when you are getting your fancy drills
42:31 and things like that, make sure
42:32 that you are recording the serial numbers on these.
42:36 It makes it easier for us to be able to locate them at the pawn shops and hopefully bring
42:41 someone to justice for at least possessing that stolen property.
42:45 Our larcenies were obviously up at the end of the third quarter.
42:50 Forty-three percent of our larcenies were from motor vehicles.
42:55 Fifty-two percent of all stolen guns came from motor vehicles.
43:02 Sixty percent of the vehicles with a gun stolen were unlocked.
43:06 I think it's absolutely horrible that people still, no matter how many times we get up
43:12 here, they still have the audacity to leave a firearm in a vehicle and leaving your firearm
43:18 unlocked, because you know what's happening to that firearm that you've left in your car
43:23 and you left it unlocked for access?
43:26 These people are going out here and using these firearms to shoot or kill someone.
43:33 Let that sink in.
43:35 And unfortunately, my officers are left with trying to investigate these cases where folks
43:40 are just not securing their firearms and are not locking their vehicles and are leaving
43:45 things out.
43:48 And it puts a tremendous workload on my team.
43:53 Motor vehicle theft up 156 percent.
43:56 Eighty-six percent of the vehicles that were stolen, not including attempts or vehicles
44:01 not registrable, have been recovered.
44:04 So we are recovering these vehicles at a high rate, and that's good.
44:08 Unfortunately, they've already been used in whatever crimes that they're going to be used
44:11 in.
44:12 Twenty-seven—I'm sorry, 21 percent of those cars that were stolen were left running unattended.
44:18 It's getting ready to get cold.
44:20 It has gotten a little chilly.
44:23 Please do not leave your vehicles running and unattended.
44:27 I had to get on my son the other day for leaving my car running and unattended.
44:32 So you are not, we are not immune to that.
44:35 But please be aware of that as winter time starts to really hit us.
44:42 Let's look at our clearance rates.
44:44 I want to just take a moment and really celebrate and uplift the work that our investigative
44:49 teams are doing, that our forensics teams are doing, our patrol officers at the very
44:55 first level, the work that they're doing to try and preserve these crime scenes, which
44:59 you know if we have good evidence going in, the likelihood that we will have a good outcome
45:05 is high.
45:07 To date, from 2023 third quarter, our homicide clearance rate, so that's cleared by arrest
45:16 or an ex-clear, is 80 percent.
45:20 That is far above what FBI previously reported in 2020 of 49 percent.
45:26 So we are clearing our homicides.
45:30 Our rates are just a little bit below, but staff is still doing a good job with those
45:35 clearances.
45:37 And then overall for our violent crime, we are slightly below clearances for the national
45:43 clearance rate for municipalities our size at 30.9 percent.
45:50 Burglaries are being cleared just below.
45:54 property crime, we have a low clearance rate, but I do want to just show you the motor vehicle
45:59 theft. We are far below national average on clearance rate for motor vehicle thefts. And
46:06 that's simply because it's very hard to find any evidence within those vehicles unless
46:11 we happen upon a group of individuals that we've been investigating for another case
46:17 that we also are looking at them as perpetuating the, or perpetrating the motor vehicle thefts.
46:26 So calls for service.
46:28 So we are slowly going up in our average response time.
46:32 So as you know, our targeted average response time is 5 minutes and 48 seconds.
46:37 We are at 6 minutes and 42 seconds.
46:41 That's up from 4.2 percent.
46:45 And from the third quarter in 2022.
46:49 We answered 49.5% of our priority one calls for service in less than five minutes through
46:54 the third quarter of 2023, which still did not meet our target of 57%.
47:01 We are responding to those priority calls.
47:06 Those priority calls are getting the fast response.
47:10 are relying very heavily on other municipalities within our region, so the
47:15 Sheriff's Department, as well as staff from North Carolina Central University,
47:20 Public Safety, Duke Public Safety. So in an effort to to really help us in some
47:27 of these response times and to help us as far as staffing wise, the watch
47:32 commanders do reach out and request assistance to to help. In addition, as you
47:39 know we started again our investigators and other sworn officers other officers
47:45 through the rank of executive staff are riding patrol our supplemental patrol
47:52 and supplemental shifts are still happening in an effort to to really
47:57 address some of the staffing issues that that we're continuing to see.
48:04 So I want to just take a moment to give you a snapshot on violent crime rate by
48:08 fiscal year and what you'll see in the next slide is the property crime rate by fiscal
48:12 year. And again, I can't take credit for these—these—this data or these slides.
48:18 You know, Jason Sheese is here. He does a great job. Mr. Huey and the rest of my—Sean
48:23 Huey and the rest of my team do an outstanding job of providing this information.
48:27 So what you're looking at of this chart is the number of violent crimes reported over
48:32 the last 11, and we do fiscal years for this, normalized as so the rate per 100,000.
48:41 Our target is to have fewer than 700 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, which is, you
48:48 see that in kind of the orange hashed line.
48:52 So if we look at the preceding 10 years, what we see is that the chance of achieving our
48:56 Our target this year was low, and that's depicted by the blue shaded area.
49:02 And so we were below our target of 700 violent crimes per 100,000.
49:09 We were actually at 612.
49:12 So our violent crimes per 100,000 has gone down, right, has decreased.
49:19 But what the data says and what it feels like to our community, it just doesn't always seem
49:25 to match up.
49:26 the data says that we are seeing a reduction in our violent crime per 100,000.
49:36 Now let's look at our motor vehicle theft incidents because that is the largest increase
49:40 that we have seen this year period.
49:44 So again, this chart actually shows the motor vehicle theft incidents over the last 20 calendar
49:51 quarters and the average number of motor vehicle thefts in this of these
49:57 incidents was 189 per quarter prior to 2023. When 2023 happened and the Kias
50:06 and the Hyundais began to be most the most effective vehicle vehicle to be
50:11 stolen that whole trajectory just skyrocketed and we that's where we've
50:16 We've seen the increase and that has been most affected on our Hyundais and Kias.
50:33 Okay, so this is our shot spotter slide.
50:38 We generally like to give just a brief snapshot of our shot spotter.
50:43 So through the third quarter of 2023, we had 1,125 published incidents.
50:48 So those are the incidents that make it to our officers once they are vetted through
50:53 ShotSpot or in the team there.
50:57 And a total of 4,245 shots were detected out of 1,125 incidents.
51:02 That's a lot of shots.
51:07 about 3.9 shots, alerts per day and three or four shots per alert.
51:15 26.3 percent of the shot spotter alerts also had a corresponding 911 call.
51:21 And but as we know and we've kind of talked about that before, that's more likely in rapid
51:26 shots and multiple fire shots versus the one-off shot.
51:31 And that's, you know, we want to encourage people to even call when they hear the one
51:35 off shot.
51:37 About 19.9% of the gunfire incidents resulted in an incident report being filed.
51:43 And that's a good thing.
51:44 That means that there was something there on scene that the officers ended up filing
51:50 a report.
51:51 With 109 of the 186 reports that we have filed being supported by a 911 call, 27 of the 186
52:01 86 reports, there was a total of 30 gunshot wounds.
52:05 So we are going to these, we are seeing people that were shot.
52:09 I do want to note that one of the 30 that we had that were pronounced dead at the scene,
52:18 victims were pronounced dead at the scene, three of the 30 refused medical transport,
52:22 seven of the 30 were taken to the hospital by another means, so somebody else put them
52:27 in a car and went to the hospital.
52:30 And 19 of the 30 were taken by EMS with five of those having life-threatening gunshot wounds.
52:38 We did have four notable shot spotter successes in this quarter.
52:43 Two shot spotter notifications actually led to arrests.
52:47 So this really helps us in terms of the time period of the shooting, how many rounds were
52:52 fired and do we receive any leads from that based off of the shell casings recovered.
52:59 One of the shot spotters notifications led to a faster medical intervention and the information
53:07 from the alert came about 47 seconds before the first 911 call.
53:11 And then one shot spotter notification did not have a corresponding 911 call from the
53:16 public.
53:17 So although the victim in this case unfortunately did not survive, that victim most likely would
53:24 have been found the next day by a community member as a result. So let's
53:35 take a look at our staffing at the end of the third quarter. Just want to give
53:39 you a brief summary of the staffing. So at the end of September our staffing was
53:44 at 77 percent. We are downed. We have a 24.7 percent vacancy rate and
53:53 And currently we do have Academy 58 that started in August,
53:58 August 14th.
53:59 We started with 15 recruits and we have 13 still left
54:03 in the Academy.
54:05 During the third quarter, the recruiting unit,
54:07 they've initiated multiple campaigns.
54:10 My staff and public affairs unit has been working
54:13 very closely with the recruiting unit,
54:16 both at offsite events, but also advertising events
54:21 occurring at the police department and also working to do some advertising on our local
54:27 buses, Durham Bulls, working with the Durham Bulls as well as the North Carolina DMV, a
54:32 hub digital advertising. So they've worked very well trying to get that information out.
54:38 We continue to do our recruiting events. So we've had 31 events this quarter. Recruiting
54:44 Union actually made 14, I'm sorry, 13 visits to Fort Liberty and they have visited colleges
54:49 and universities throughout the area to include Johnson C. Smith, Meredith College, Elizabeth
54:56 City State, App State, UNC Greensboro, and working with North Carolina Central University
55:01 on a much bigger endeavor that we hope will prove to be very successful for us in the
55:09 future.
55:12 So our U visa requests, those continue to come in. From July through September, we're
55:19 We received 58 U visa requests.
55:22 We approved 40 of those and 18 were denied.
55:25 So we try to address those U visa requests and either approve or
55:30 deny and provide follow up once they are received so that we do not have a backlog.
55:39 And that concludes my presentation and I will just want to end the presentation
55:45 by saying that public safety is not for the faint at heart,
55:50 whether you all are on that dais,
55:53 you know, and those that are here in the audience,
55:56 my staff, sworn and non-sworn,
55:59 public safety is not for the faint at heart.
56:01 And so, Mayor O'Neill,
56:05 Council Member Holsey-Hyman,
56:07 and I know Council Member Johnson is not here,
56:09 from the Durham Police Department,
56:11 We want to thank you for your service to our community.
56:15 Thank you for serving us well.
56:19 And we wish you well in your future endeavors.
56:23 I know you're not going anywhere
56:24 and that we wouldn't have it any other way.
56:26 And for our current council members
56:30 that will still continue to serve,
56:32 I say congratulations and thank you for continuing
56:35 to pick up that torch and lead.
56:37 That concludes my presentation.
56:39 Thank you, Chief.
56:40 Are there any comments from colleagues?
56:44 We'll just go straight down the road.
56:46 Thank you.
56:47 I would just offer thanks as well to you and our team.
56:52 Just understanding like it's been really hard coming out of COVID to figure out what we can do
57:01 to kind of address the vacancies, and I really wanted to just take a moment and just say
57:07 that whatever it is that we can do,
57:12 just continue to keep asking,
57:13 because I'm confident that we will be more supportive
57:19 as we move forward.
57:20 I'm mindful that I wanted to congratulate,
57:24 sorry, I made a note,
57:26 investigator Deborah Smith
57:29 with the North Carolina Law Enforcement Women's Association,
57:34 just for that, the appreciation for her work
57:37 and just acknowledging like with this shortage,
57:40 how difficult it becomes to do investigations
57:43 is really what concerns me the most.
57:46 And I'm thinking through, I know I live in a neighborhood
57:50 where ShotSpotter has been very helpful
57:53 because I think it gets the call in quicker
57:56 than the phone calls.
57:58 And I know there's been at least two deaths
58:01 and a number of folks who have been hit,
58:05 where the response has been helpful.
58:07 And so I'm very clear that that's not an answer.
58:11 And what that looks like moving forward, I think I have
58:15 to take a page from, you know, those in the room who are trying
58:18 to thank Mayor O'Neill for the work
58:21 that she's tried to get done here.
58:23 And we've got to figure out, to Mr. Garrett's point,
58:27 what's going to stop these kids?
58:29 because they're really young, I mean, even up to 30,
58:35 from shooting each other, because that's not a response
58:38 that you naturally occur, like it doesn't just naturally occur
58:41 for you to just shoot at one another.
58:43 And so I'm mindful of that and I will continue
58:46 to support Hatai Reborn Justice Movement and the work of many
58:51 of their partners to try and just get
58:53 to these folks before they pick up a gun,
58:56 which is when they're younger.
58:58 And I'm interested in what it looks like for recruitment.
59:04 I know that the COPS program
59:05 or COPS initiative was moved forward.
59:08 What your recruitment looks like, and not today,
59:10 but just kind of going forward, kind of parsing
59:12 out where female recruitment and numbers are, so that we're
59:20 watching and tracking if it's really taking effect over time.
59:25 There's a lot of prongs in this that, you know,
59:31 we've been trying to touch on.
59:33 And I'm, yeah, there's a lot of pieces to this.
59:40 And I will say that I'm grateful that the HEART program's
59:43 in place to do some of that work.
59:46 And when it goes to countywide, I think that'll be even better.
59:50 And then also just another thought,
59:54 if you're tracking response times as well,
59:59 I don't know how that works, but you probably could speak
01:00:00 to how you're tracking response times if Derm Tech or Central
01:00:05 or Duke University are picking it up.
01:00:08 But probably trying to give us more information around
01:00:12 that in the next quarterly report so that we know.
01:00:15 Because I'm having a, I'm thinking
01:00:18 that it's probably going to be a while before we get there
01:00:21 if you've only got 13 recruits.
01:00:23 So those are my initial thoughts.
01:00:27 I'm still reading the report.
01:00:29 This Granicus situation is really difficult
01:00:31 for me right now.
01:00:33 But I do appreciate what your officers,
01:00:36 what the entire public safety department is doing.
01:00:40 And I left the National League of Cities with some great ideas
01:00:45 around domestic violence and I want to have conversations
01:00:47 about that and how we can partner to do some work with the fire department.
01:00:52 And so I really have some hope in this and I'm looking forward to that.
01:00:59 Thank you, that's all.
01:01:03 Thank you.
01:01:04 Good afternoon, good to see you.
01:01:06 Hope you're healing quickly.
01:01:07 I just really, I liked the addition of slide, the two slides where that showed the longer term data trends.
01:01:14 It's very helpful for our community to see what we feel and perceive isn't necessarily,
01:01:20 while crimes increase this year, we're still seeing overall lowering of trends.
01:01:27 I've reached out around meeting because I know that I'm certainly hearing from our
01:01:33 Latino community about a lot of fear, and rightly so.
01:01:38 And I know that a few months ago, I think the last time you were here, I said,
01:01:41 are we going to be doing in preparation for the holiday season, because we've seen this trend before.
01:01:45 I really appreciate the event that was held.
01:01:48 I was not able to go.
01:01:49 I was out of town.
01:01:50 But please know that you have my support, and whatever you need, I will happily show up
01:01:54 and do whatever is necessary.
01:01:57 For the folks out there who are targeting the Latino community, it is quite sickening to me
01:02:06 that you would target hardworking folks who are often undocumented
01:02:11 And so when you rob them of the cash that they've earned,
01:02:14 the impact on them and their family
01:02:17 is a ripple effect that, quite frankly,
01:02:19 if you are a US citizen or have status, you don't understand.
01:02:30 So the lack of compassion of what that means
01:02:36 and the lack of awareness of what harm you actually
01:02:39 are causing to folks is it's just,
01:02:42 it's quite frankly disturbing.
01:02:44 And I really wish the folks who are making that choice
01:02:50 would stop.
01:02:51 Obviously a robbery on anyone and anyone in our community
01:02:54 is horrific, but the fact that you're targeting folks
01:02:57 who are often the folks that are the least of these,
01:03:01 these are not folks who have safety nets.
01:03:03 It's why the evictions in our Latino community
01:03:05 have been so horrific during the pandemic,
01:03:08 because they didn't have a safety net.
01:03:10 They can't apply for unemployment.
01:03:11 They can't apply for Medicaid.
01:03:14 So many of the things that catch a lot of us
01:03:16 if we are hit on hard times, they don't get it.
01:03:19 They show up to work.
01:03:21 They've struggled a lot to get here.
01:03:23 They have fled situations that we, quite frankly,
01:03:25 do not understand.
01:03:27 And I'm sick of it, and I need Durham
01:03:31 and every single resident and neighbor
01:03:32 who calls the city home to step up and help our neighbors.
01:03:37 It's not okay.
01:03:39 It happens over and over and over again.
01:03:41 I want to thank the folks at PNUM and other places
01:03:44 who are working diligently to get the word out
01:03:47 in our community.
01:03:50 But it is kind of, it's just gobsmacking
01:03:54 that folks would create that kind of harm
01:03:57 and target folks intentionally
01:04:00 because that's what's happening.
01:04:01 It's predatory behavior and it's gross.
01:04:03 So I know that your staff is working diligently and please count on my support.
01:04:10 And thank you.
01:04:15 I know we've seen some overall trends that are not great.
01:04:18 I think the car theft, it is national.
01:04:21 My mom's Kia got stolen in Tucson, Arizona, completely destroyed.
01:04:25 So it is a national trend that is affecting a lot of folks who maybe you can't afford to replace your car.
01:04:32 And so if it gets totaled, that's a lot of people's means
01:04:36 to work.
01:04:38 And a lot of folks don't have several thousand dollars just
01:04:40 sitting around to replace a vehicle.
01:04:42 So I was with your police officers
01:04:45 when I was doing a ride along, and I don't even
01:04:47 remember how many car thefts we got that night.
01:04:50 And I know our police officers do a really diligent job
01:04:53 trying to take evidence, and it takes hours of their time
01:04:56 to try and collect prints and help the community members
01:05:00 whose cars have been stolen.
01:05:01 So again, really thank your staff.
01:05:07 Thank you, Madam Mayor, Chief.
01:05:08 It's always good to see you and your staff that's present.
01:05:12 Please, as always, extend our gratefulness to the men and women under your command.
01:05:15 First, I just want to fully associate myself with your comment, your observation that,
01:05:20 in spite of the overall trend of violent crime going down,
01:05:25 that is absolutely of no solace to victims.
01:05:28 If you've had a family member that's been shot or raped,
01:05:31 we can't talk to you about the aggregate trend going in the right direction.
01:05:35 It's important that the public knows that, but this is not a victory lap, and
01:05:40 we've got a lot of work to do, particularly when it comes to gunfire and rapes.
01:05:44 I want to say to you publicly, this is the first time I think you've been before us since the incident on 147,
01:05:49 which received some national attention where our highway was shut down.
01:05:53 And I want to congratulate you and your command staff for the way that that incident was handled.
01:05:59 Folk like us who are in the political arena sometimes try and use things for purposes to further our agenda.
01:06:07 Those of us who are familiar with the way government works in the state of North Carolina knows that Durham City Council has no tactical command of the police department.
01:06:15 We don't pick up the phone and order you to do things.
01:06:18 We are several layers removed from that.
01:06:21 And pretending that we are doesn't really help matters.
01:06:24 And I wanna say publicly that our police department has been noted for
01:06:29 the way we handle crowd management situations.
01:06:32 I think you handled it brilliantly that day.
01:06:35 Durham is not lawless.
01:06:37 We are not without order.
01:06:40 As a matter of fact, for our friends that like to tell that North Carolina is the most
01:06:44 business friendly place in the country, as part because of our tax structure.
01:06:50 When those businesses come here, the city they want to stay in most likely is Durham.
01:06:54 The place where their folk want to live is Durham.
01:06:56 The driver of our economic engine is Durham.
01:07:00 So we're not lawless, we're not orderliness and without order and you play a large part in that.
01:07:04 So I want to congratulate you and thank you for the way you handled that situation on 147.
01:07:09 Had an opportunity to brag on you at National League of Cities last week.
01:07:14 I presented to colleagues there about the way we engage the public around new technology
01:07:20 rollouts.
01:07:21 The ShotSpotter was used as a case study.
01:07:23 And I had a chance to talk to colleagues from all over the country about the way you and
01:07:27 your team here in Durham engage the public, the portal and website that you've shown us,
01:07:34 bracketing out whether you agree with the technology or not, but the way that we handle
01:07:37 community engagement is becoming a model.
01:07:41 And I was very pleased to be able to brag on you folk, presenting to colleagues from
01:07:44 around the country in Atlanta this past week.
01:07:47 So I want to congratulate you on that and thank you for the transparency and openness
01:07:50 of the technology.
01:07:52 And finally, just a quick question, Chief.
01:07:55 Some time ago, there were some questions around some of our special teams and there was some
01:08:00 scrutiny, particularly traffic stops and some incidents in the McDougal Terrace area.
01:08:06 Could you give us kind of just a quick Reader's Digest status report on our deployment and
01:08:11 use of specialized teams and how that's going?
01:08:14 I know relative to our staffing situations as well, it's going to give us a 30,000 foot
01:08:18 view of how we're deploying or using or if we're still using specialized teams, enforcement
01:08:23 teams.
01:08:24 So, we are not using them only because of the staffing.
01:08:29 So, you know, as an exec team, we have to make some very tough decisions.
01:08:36 And you know, obviously our patrol officers, if we can't respond to your call in a timely
01:08:40 manner, you know, it doesn't really matter how many people you have on specialized units
01:08:44 if you're not answering that call.
01:08:46 So we have had to take CAT and move CAT back to Uniform Patrol.
01:08:53 So they are answering 911 calls.
01:08:57 We've had to do some more shifting and flexing with our criminal investigations division
01:09:02 and our organized crime to continue to figure out how we can handle the load that's coming
01:09:09 in as well as our units that specifically function around outreach.
01:09:19 We're having to make some tough decisions so that we can be there and also, too, so
01:09:24 that our officers feel safe.
01:09:27 Officers have to feel safe in order to be able to respond. We have to keep them
01:09:31 mentally ready as well is making sure that they're that they're safe as we
01:09:37 move forward to securing our city. But we've had to make some changes and one
01:09:41 of the first that was felt was moving cat back to uniform patrol to solely
01:09:47 answer 911 calls. Our selective enforcement team is doing the same in
01:09:52 between some of their normal duties as well as members of organized crime division and
01:09:59 CID.
01:10:00 I noticed, Chief, that the response time for shot spotter alerts seems to be closer to
01:10:07 our goal for how we want to respond to 911 calls.
01:10:12 And is that in part because the alerts go directly to the car?
01:10:16 How would you account for that?
01:10:18 Yes.
01:10:19 So it's two things.
01:10:21 So one, it's one of the things that when we embarked on the ShotSpotter pilot, we also
01:10:28 looked at how we prioritize shots, sound of shots, right?
01:10:33 That also came on the heels of inviting Dr. Cook back in to do a refresh study from the
01:10:40 2017 study that he had done on our response to violent nonfatal shooting incidents.
01:10:46 And so what we found was how we responded has really was kind of outdated for our shots
01:10:52 fired calls.
01:10:54 And so we moved those from a priority three response to a priority two response citywide.
01:10:59 And then yes, so that increased the response time.
01:11:04 But also too, ShotSpotter allows us to, the officers are notified before communications
01:11:11 even receives that first call.
01:11:13 So officers are notified in the cars, they start going in that direction.
01:11:19 Theoretically, they call into communications or communications will notify and
01:11:24 say there's been a shot spot or alert, and the officers are already on the way.
01:11:29 So yes, so it has changed the way we respond to sound of shots.
01:11:32 But also city wide, it's changed the priority that we have placed on sound of
01:11:37 shots based upon previous practices and best practices.
01:11:43 Thank you so much for that, Chief.
01:11:44 Happy Thanksgiving to you and your entire team.
01:11:46 Thank you, thank you, Madam Mayor.
01:11:47 Thank you.
01:11:50 We'll go to our right.
01:11:51 Thank you.
01:11:52 Left.
01:11:53 Thank you so much, Chief.
01:11:55 It's great to see you and your team.
01:11:58 Quick question.
01:12:00 Some of my colleagues already have discussed some of my points that I wrote down.
01:12:04 But I think what's really standing out is the amount of juvenile infractions.
01:12:11 Our kids are out and about and they're getting in a lot of trouble.
01:12:18 And I know that there's no police response time that's considered as a solution.
01:12:27 Do you, I'm pressing the envelope here, because you're chief of police.
01:12:32 However, we're Durham and-
01:12:34 You never do that.
01:12:36 You guys are awesome.
01:12:37 So any ideas or desires or wishes you think we could supplement some of what you all are
01:12:46 doing in regards of responding to our youth?
01:12:50 I mean, I just, I would say this is that, you know, we are doing at the police department,
01:12:56 we are capacity.
01:12:58 Right.
01:12:59 Right.
01:13:00 And so even with some of our partnerships, we're at capacity because I have to have officers
01:13:06 to manage those partnerships.
01:13:09 What I will say is if as a community group,
01:13:13 especially again our large community groups,
01:13:16 you know really it's about intervention and being
01:13:19 consistent with it, right?
01:13:21 North Carolina Central University is you know is
01:13:25 constantly doing work in our communities where it's most,
01:13:29 the work is most needed with our kids.
01:13:32 Doesn't have to be a partnership with the police
01:13:34 department, doesn't even have to be a partnership with the
01:13:36 the City of Durham. There just needs to be a connection. So we need the help. The police
01:13:42 department is at this point not able to carry that torch in the way that we have done in
01:13:49 5, 10, 15 years prior. And I would say too is that our parents of these children, our
01:13:57 guardians of these children, what we also too see just going and responding to these
01:14:01 calls is that they are in need of help. I don't know what that help looks like because
01:14:06 it's different for everyone, but I think it's, you know, and I've heard it said in several
01:14:14 places is we can't just simply tell people what they need, right? It's we have to ask
01:14:20 them what they need. And that's something that at the police department it's not always
01:14:25 easy for us to do because it can be perceived as us trying to do something else with other
01:14:31 motives. But I do think we have enough people in this community that we should be able to
01:14:38 start addressing, you know, what do the guardians need, what do the parents need, and how do
01:14:43 you get that to the kids, right? So I will just give a huge shout out to Mr. Fredrick
01:14:52 McNeil. Many of you know him. I will tell you I was happy to know him when Sidekicks
01:14:59 was not getting the publicity it's getting now when they didn't get the checks.
01:15:03 But one thing that he had been doing is he had been consistent in his endeavor.
01:15:11 And it has really made a difference in those kids at Burton in a tremendous way, in a groundbreaking
01:15:19 way.
01:15:20 So I know you didn't ask for all that, but.
01:15:22 No, you went right into where I was headed.
01:15:25 So I appreciate that.
01:15:28 I appreciate you really defining the lane
01:15:31 that your department plays because our kids are bored.
01:15:36 There's just too much time on their hands across the city.
01:15:39 And we also, Council Member Jose-Herman,
01:15:44 I remember one of our first conversations
01:15:46 is around mentorship.
01:15:48 We have a lot of organizations in the city
01:15:51 that are mentoring,
01:15:52 but there's a lot of mentoring in isolation.
01:15:55 And I think that as a community,
01:15:57 it's time for us to scale, scale our relationships,
01:16:00 expand our capacity.
01:16:02 I look forward to working on those things.
01:16:05 And not adding another thing to your plate,
01:16:08 but I know for a fact that our officers
01:16:12 have a lot of relationships in the streets as well.
01:16:15 Durham is unique in that way.
01:16:17 And I would love to hear,
01:16:20 just not even necessarily in a formal capacity,
01:16:23 but I would love to talk with some of them
01:16:25 hear some of those conversations,
01:16:27 because they've built relationships,
01:16:30 and I plan to do the same.
01:16:36 It just, there are some conversations
01:16:38 that are happening right now
01:16:39 that I look forward to talking more about
01:16:42 that will hopefully have a citywide impact
01:16:46 on youth engagement.
01:16:49 Regarding the cars being left unlocked while running,
01:16:54 I used to be guilty of that myself,
01:16:55 but I did it when I was back home.
01:16:57 Where you can leave your doors unlocked, too,
01:17:00 in the country, but the behavior is different here.
01:17:04 Is there any type of accountability?
01:17:08 And this is probably something at the state level,
01:17:12 but is there any type of accountability
01:17:16 that can be held if you have a gun?
01:17:19 And I know folks beyond the local level
01:17:21 want to praise guns more than people.
01:17:26 But is there any type of accountability that can be held on if you have a firearm in your
01:17:31 car, you are responsible for being responsible?
01:17:34 Well, let me start this by saying, one, we never ever want to victimize a victim, right?
01:17:41 We all in this room understand the concept of we've been taught that if you set something
01:17:46 somewhere it should be there when you get back.
01:17:49 But we are not in that world anymore.
01:17:52 And we have to embrace and understand that reality.
01:17:56 And by embrace, I mean that's where we are.
01:18:00 That's not going to change anytime soon.
01:18:03 Having said that, we have to change our behaviors in how we go about our daily lives, including
01:18:10 how we secure our firearms.
01:18:14 And you know, I would say to you that that's a legislative decision.
01:18:20 Certainly I'm disappointed that there is not anything, you know, under—so right now the
01:18:25 law says, you know, to be charged with failing to secure your firearm, a child must have
01:18:30 access to it and have hurt someone or what have you with it.
01:18:34 It does not—it doesn't align with what we are seeing where a firearm is taken because
01:18:41 it's left in the glove box, right? And so that's a legislative action. And again, this
01:18:49 is not in any way punishing or punishing a victim, right? Because we don't want to do
01:18:55 that. But at the same time, we also have to be very aware that if you are—if you call
01:18:59 yourself a responsible gun owner, that's not responsible. And you either—you carry
01:19:07 it safely or you just shouldn't have it.
01:19:12 So.
01:19:13 No, thank you for that.
01:19:14 And my, where I was headed with that is at some point, you know, we became required to
01:19:19 wear seat belts, you know, and at some point you have to be required to secure your firearm
01:19:26 if you're going to have one.
01:19:28 But I know that's not that we can handle here at the local level.
01:19:32 But thank you for that.
01:19:33 And lastly, have we seen, and I don't know if this question was asked or not, have we
01:19:37 Have you seen any uptick in, here at the local level,
01:19:41 attacks on the Muslim or Jewish or Asian community since these?
01:19:47 So what I'll say is this, is have we seen an increase in reported incidents?
01:19:52 I wouldn't say we've seen a significant increase, but what we have seen is an increase in
01:19:57 information coming into our intelligence unit that we've had to vet for any potential threat.
01:20:06 So we have seen an increase, which actually is very good, because that means people are
01:20:10 seeing things that don't seem quite right, and they're reporting it for us to vet.
01:20:16 Right?
01:20:17 So we are constantly doing that.
01:20:21 But we also are constantly in conversations with all of our faith communities, especially
01:20:27 in a time that we're in right now on what to watch for and when to call us and when
01:20:33 something is just not considered something small.
01:20:36 So we are seeing an increase in just things being reported to us and I can appreciate that and I'm thankful for that.
01:20:42 But as far as isolated incidents, we're not seeing just that increase in incidents
01:20:50 that we can say are done simply because of someone's faith or background.
01:20:56 Thank you, and I know you mentioned just earlier in closing,
01:21:00 members of our Hispanic community have been targeted.
01:21:04 I just really would like our neighbors to see something, say something, please.
01:21:10 We don't have the capacity to predict when someone is going to act, but
01:21:16 if you see it, say something.
01:21:19 Thank you.
01:21:23 Hi.
01:21:24 How are you?
01:21:25 First of all, I just want to say it's been a pleasure for the last 19 months to work
01:21:29 with you and your officers.
01:21:33 You always think of things outside the box and you know that I have a creative spirit
01:21:37 and so I appreciate that.
01:21:39 I also want to say thank you to the commercial I saw recently and I think our person here
01:21:45 is in the audience.
01:21:48 Shout out to you in terms of the commercial because I was looking and I was like, oh,
01:21:51 I know that person.
01:21:52 And then it was really educational because, first of all, it was creative, it was cute,
01:21:56 but it was also educational.
01:21:58 I don't know who the perpetrator was because they were good too, but I want to just say
01:22:02 thank you for that innovative, again, innovative, creative education around leaving your cars
01:22:07 unlocked, around the car, you know, the safety arm in the car.
01:22:11 It was like all of those things that you're talking about was in that commercial, so I
01:22:14 want to thank you for that.
01:22:15 I also want to just piggyback on our mayor-elect, Leonardo Williams.
01:22:21 He knows that one of the first things when I came on council, we had the same passion
01:22:25 about mentorship.
01:22:27 And I am not going to be on council anymore, but I do know and feel that I think this council
01:22:31 will continue to push the work.
01:22:33 You know, January will be mentoring month.
01:22:36 I also asked for money in the budget to look at the collaborations around mentoring organizations
01:22:44 because just in my 19 months, you know, I've spoke with a lot of the mentoring programs
01:22:48 and it's like one person is applying for a grant
01:22:51 for aftercare, another person is applying for a grant
01:22:54 for maybe mental health,
01:22:55 and they're not really working together.
01:22:58 And one of the things that I also want to say, too,
01:23:00 in terms of Mr. Freddie McNeil,
01:23:02 like I actually worked a lot with him, too,
01:23:05 and I will continue to do that on the side.
01:23:07 But it's just disheartening to me
01:23:09 that now everybody wants to come and give a check,
01:23:12 and now everybody wants to be on TV and interview him.
01:23:15 But he literally put a lot of his own money and time
01:23:18 into that program.
01:23:19 And so there's a lot of mentoring programs out there
01:23:21 that are struggling, that are trying to kind of start
01:23:24 with our kids.
01:23:25 But I will say too that, especially around this time
01:23:27 of the holiday, it is survival of the fittest.
01:23:30 Most of you know my story.
01:23:31 I came from the South Bronx in New York, public housing.
01:23:34 And if I didn't have people that wrapped around services
01:23:36 around me, if I didn't have those programs,
01:23:38 and if I didn't have a praying mother,
01:23:40 I wouldn't be sitting here, right?
01:23:41 And so you have to look at the things
01:23:43 of why youth are getting involved.
01:23:45 First of all, again, employment issues, training things,
01:23:49 education and housing.
01:23:50 Those are the things that our children are lacking.
01:23:53 And not only are they lacking it,
01:23:54 but again, when you have a mother who has told me,
01:23:57 come get this 10 year old
01:23:58 because I don't know what to do with them,
01:23:59 that's a problem.
01:24:00 So we're failing our people here in Durham.
01:24:03 And so I am praying and hoping,
01:24:05 and I'm just gonna say I know that this continued council
01:24:09 will continue to work
01:24:11 and continue to press the work that I started
01:24:13 because I didn't have that much time with 19 months.
01:24:15 And I'm hoping the mentoring program continues,
01:24:18 the celebration continues.
01:24:19 I'm hoping that 50,000 that I did get in the budget
01:24:22 in terms of collaboration mentoring,
01:24:23 I know that, like I said, Mayor-Elec Williams,
01:24:27 we share that passion.
01:24:28 I know we all do, but I know we've had those conversations.
01:24:30 So I'm just praying that that work continues to go on.
01:24:33 And I thank you again.
01:24:34 Thank you, thank you.
01:24:37 Well, Chief, I've had a lot of experience
01:24:41 working with police departments, sheriff's departments,
01:24:46 just law enforcement in general over the last 29 years,
01:24:49 but the last two years has really given me
01:24:52 an inside peek at what you actually do,
01:24:55 but at a distance.
01:24:56 And I just wanna let the community know
01:24:58 that all that she does, you don't see a lot of it.
01:25:05 Most of it, you don't see.
01:25:08 And about every week, we get about two or three emails coming
01:25:15 to the mayor's office.
01:25:17 A lot of times, you're not even copied on them.
01:25:20 And someone has a complaint about something that's going
01:25:24 on in their neighborhood and something
01:25:27 that they feel the police could be or are not doing.
01:25:31 Everyone that I have turned over to, forwarded
01:25:35 to the city manager, deputy city manager of both Ferguson,
01:25:41 where the police department resides on his portfolio,
01:25:45 and to you, you have answered within 24 hours
01:25:49 with a very long detailed answer.
01:25:51 We just did that just this week on an issue.
01:25:55 And so, the care and concern and the time that you put
01:26:00 in to this job, I want you to know that I have seen it
01:26:04 and I appreciate it.
01:26:06 And you have done an excellent job of upholding the professionalism of the Durham Police Department.
01:26:15 And we've been very fortunate to have great chiefs in the city.
01:26:19 We have one former chief sitting out in the audience that you will hear from later, I'm sure,
01:26:24 former chief Steve Chalmers, who's a good friend of mine as well as I have a lot of respect for him.
01:26:31 So the road that has been paved of excellence has only grown wider and longer under you.
01:26:41 And I thank you for what you do.
01:26:44 There's no amount of money that one can pay you for
01:26:49 that care and concern that you show to our citizens.
01:26:54 Especially during these hard times when you're watching crime go up.
01:26:57 And both you and I are parents of black boys, black young men.
01:27:03 And that's who's dying on our streets in a lot of instances.
01:27:07 And it's painful for us to watch.
01:27:09 And you're in it every day trying to make a difference.
01:27:13 But it's going to take more than you and your police department.
01:27:16 It's going to take an entire community to fix some
01:27:19 of the problems that ill us.
01:27:21 And it's not rocket science.
01:27:23 It really is not.
01:27:25 It's a matter of where our priorities are
01:27:27 and how we want to put time in as a community.
01:27:29 So you're gonna hear from a group in a few minutes
01:27:32 that volunteered over a year,
01:27:35 trying to do some deep-dive research
01:27:38 in some of the issues that plague us.
01:27:40 But I do want to commend you, along with Mayor Pro Tem,
01:27:45 about your handling of very angry people
01:27:51 who were upset with you
01:27:53 and you'll call on how you handle the protesters
01:27:57 in the highway.
01:27:59 And I got a lot of those phone calls
01:28:01 and also was able to see
01:28:04 from one of our gubernatorial candidates,
01:28:08 his comments that the mayor,
01:28:10 and reference me as a he, I'm not a he.
01:28:15 So first thing, when you run for public office,
01:28:17 at least do your basic homework
01:28:19 if you are going to be trying to be the governor of this state.
01:28:27 Let's do a basic civic lesson.
01:28:29 First of all, I'm not a he.
01:28:32 Second of all, Durham County, Durham City,
01:28:36 is about the fourth largest city in this state.
01:28:39 So know a little bit about how we operate.
01:28:43 We are called, and it's not unique to Durham,
01:28:47 a strong manager-mayor system.
01:28:52 The manager hires the police chief.
01:28:56 She has a deputy city manager, and that person
01:29:00 is Bo Ferguson.
01:29:02 He, the Durham Police Department,
01:29:04 is one of many departments under his portfolio.
01:29:08 The city council in Durham, North Carolina, mayor,
01:29:14 I'm sorry, governor, trying to be governor.
01:29:19 The manager is responsible and the deputy city manager and
01:29:26 the police chief are responsible for the day to day actions of the police department.
01:29:33 That does not fall under the jurisdiction of the mayor,
01:29:37 this female mayor, or these council members.
01:29:42 Does not fall that way.
01:29:43 We are a policy-making board.
01:29:48 And the day-to-day actions in Durham, North Carolina,
01:29:53 for the police department fall under this lady right here,
01:29:56 sitting to my right,
01:29:58 Bo Ferguson, who's sitting over there,
01:30:01 and the police chief.
01:30:02 So anytime you tell me what I need to do,
01:30:05 you better be ready to make sure that I can do it.
01:30:10 So be careful.
01:30:12 You ought to know what you're doing when you get in this arena
01:30:15 and you're trying to be the governor,
01:30:17 that you know what people can and cannot do.
01:30:24 And I'm glad to tell you that.
01:30:27 So, thank you, Chief.
01:30:29 Thank you.
01:30:29 For all that you do and any questions,
01:30:33 he's free to call me.
01:30:34 But get your information right.
01:30:36 And you better know, I'm a female.
01:30:39 I am not a he.
01:30:41 I'm a she.
01:30:42 Get that right, at the very least.
01:30:46 Any other thing that I gotta do?
01:30:47 I need to do a civic lesson.
01:30:49 Can we do a basic lesson on civics?
01:30:52 Oh, my God.
01:30:53 Okay, but anyway.
01:30:54 I just wanna ask the media, did you all get that?
01:30:56 No.
01:30:58 Please deliver it.
01:30:59 I hope he's watching.
01:31:01 That's my gift to him.
01:31:04 I am not afraid to speak the truth.
01:31:08 So know what you're talking about
01:31:09 before you put something on my table for me to do.
01:31:14 Know what my job is first.
01:31:17 Thank you, Chief, for a job well done to you and your team.
01:31:21 We appreciate you all.
01:31:24 Thank you so much.
01:31:29 I wanted us to have this conversation
01:31:32 about our first quarter, our first, what is this, our third quarter, Crown Report.
01:31:43 Before we talk to some folk that I have a lot of admiration for, who've been doing a
01:31:49 lot of work.
01:31:50 And I'm going to move to the other podium because we have a little thank you for them.
01:32:02 So, when I first became mayor, there was a lot of stuff that comes at you about things
01:32:14 that you can do and be involved in.
01:32:16 But one of the greatest opportunities that the city of Durham has had was involvement
01:32:25 with what we call the Bloomberg-Harvard City Leadership Initiative.
01:32:31 And Durham is a legacy city.
01:32:34 Mayor Steve Schewer was invited to be a part of the first, I think he might have been a
01:32:39 part of the sixth cohort of mayors from across the world actually, who were invited to participate
01:32:48 in a program started by former mayor Michael Bloomberg.
01:32:54 He was the former mayor of New York City.
01:32:56 And he was able to put together some programming,
01:33:02 specifically gear for mayors and staff.
01:33:07 And so we're the second year doing this, I believe.
01:33:12 And the first year we had involvement from city staff
01:33:18 as well as Steve Shule himself.
01:33:21 And it's a really great program.
01:33:24 they take you in there.
01:33:25 Bloomberg, you know, Michael Bloomberg is a billionaire.
01:33:27 So you get the billionaire kind of treatment.
01:33:29 And I'm encouraging, as we have our transition talk
01:33:32 with our mayor-elect, I'm encouraging him
01:33:34 to stay in that space because not only do you get
01:33:37 the billionaire kind of treatment when you go
01:33:40 to these events out of town, you also get the best
01:33:45 and brightest minds to help you think about
01:33:47 what's going on in your city and what's happening
01:33:49 across the nation, right, with other mayors.
01:33:52 The mayors are kind of a unique politician,
01:33:55 a brand of politician, because when we come together,
01:34:00 you really don't talk about party lines.
01:34:02 You know, being Democrat or Republican
01:34:05 never has come up in those conversation.
01:34:08 We are on the ground and we want to make sure
01:34:11 that we are moving our cities along.
01:34:13 So I have enjoyed my time with Bloomberg
01:34:18 and the opportunities that they have given me.
01:34:21 We just got back, some, myself and some city employees
01:34:25 went up for a conference in DC
01:34:31 and we were treated royally for about two or three days
01:34:35 and learned a lot.
01:34:37 But as a part of that program,
01:34:39 you also get to pick something that the mayor wants to do
01:34:45 over a year's time and they provide expertise
01:34:50 to come in and help you figure out
01:34:52 what that something is and how you wanna solve it.
01:34:56 So a lot of people, a lot of cities pick projects,
01:35:00 you know, different projects kind of things.
01:35:03 But me, you all know my background,
01:35:05 I wanted to try to enhance what I call the not sexy work.
01:35:10 And that is when you try to do,
01:35:13 really get down into the basics
01:35:17 of why things are happening, right?
01:35:19 So we already always talk about the root causes of crime.
01:35:23 And I know that there are root causes,
01:35:27 but we would never really articulate
01:35:29 how you expect people to navigate
01:35:31 some of the issues that cause crime.
01:35:35 And they're all interconnected.
01:35:37 Housing is key for everybody.
01:35:42 Everybody.
01:35:43 And so when I thought about it,
01:35:45 one of the things that I wanted to try to do
01:35:47 to enhance our knowledge base and try to begin
01:35:51 to pull together various pieces of information
01:35:54 from our community so that once the policy makers
01:35:57 have the information, they are able to take that
01:36:00 and then utilize that to create better policies,
01:36:03 better situations where they can have
01:36:06 this information available.
01:36:07 And so I said I really wanna concentrate on barriers
01:36:12 for those who have been involved
01:36:15 in the criminal justice arena.
01:36:18 It's one thing to watch people pay
01:36:21 or be punished for the crimes that they commit
01:36:26 and they do that, right?
01:36:27 We have a system that do that, that does that.
01:36:30 But what has actually happened in North Carolina
01:36:32 and pretty much all over the nation
01:36:34 is once you have some touch from this system of justice
01:36:40 and it leaves a record,
01:36:42 Society punishes you further because you're not allowed to
01:36:46 get housing, right?
01:36:49 They ask about whether you have a prior record, whether you can
01:36:54 what that prior record was on most applications.
01:36:58 And most people don't understand what that barrier is or how we
01:37:02 overcome it.
01:37:03 So, we called together a group of people to kind of help us
01:37:09 to lead this effort and they have studied this for what,
01:37:13 about over a year now.
01:37:15 And we have a lead from the city,
01:37:18 we had two at the time that it started.
01:37:20 Amber Wade was working as my assistant now,
01:37:23 she's graduated and gone on to USC to work over there.
01:37:27 And Carmichael Wallace, our chief of staff,
01:37:30 were the city contacts.
01:37:32 And I pulled together some folk that I've been working with
01:37:35 for a long time and asked them
01:37:36 if they would take this ride with us.
01:37:38 It required a lot of time.
01:37:40 They committed to a weekly meeting for a period of time.
01:37:45 And Ms. Wallace will tell you more
01:37:47 about what they have been doing in her presentation.
01:37:51 But I could not walk away from this assignment
01:37:55 that I've had over the last two years
01:37:58 without saying thank you to this group of individuals
01:38:01 who gave so much.
01:38:02 They gave the five hours plus of community service.
01:38:06 They gave that.
01:38:07 And they have studied this issue and they come back today
01:38:11 to present to you all some of the things that they found
01:38:15 in their study of barriers for young,
01:38:18 for people who have a criminal justice background.
01:38:21 And I'd like to recognize them today
01:38:25 on my final work session because this is where my heart is.
01:38:29 This is the passion for this work
01:38:32 and for those young people and older people.
01:38:36 now we have people who are 60, my age, 60 years old,
01:38:40 who've never been able to be on the lease,
01:38:43 who've never had the ability to have housing in their name.
01:38:47 And what does that do to a man
01:38:50 when you can't be on the lease, or a woman?
01:38:55 It cuts to the very heart of what you can be and do.
01:39:00 And so for these people who have taken their time
01:39:03 over these years, over this last year,
01:39:05 and studied and come back with this report today,
01:39:09 I just want to say thank you and be able to present
01:39:13 this certificate of appreciation from the city of Durham
01:39:17 for being a part of the Bloomberg Harvard
01:39:21 Innovation Track Core Team, and they have been innovative.
01:39:26 I don't know that there's any other city
01:39:29 that has taken the opportunity to do this kind of work
01:39:33 in the Bloomberg Harvard.
01:39:35 initiative. So Mr. Colin Davis, if you will come and then if you stand right
01:39:45 here with me because I want to get a picture. Mike, birthday boy, can you get a
01:39:51 picture of us when we get up here? Thank you. Ms. Roshanna Parker and
01:39:55 congratulations. She has been elevated to a new position. She has taken the place
01:40:00 of Guggenheimer over and the name has changed. We have a new director and we
01:40:05 We have a new name change.
01:40:06 So what's the new name?
01:40:07 Justice Services Department.
01:40:09 Justice Services Department.
01:40:10 So thank you, Sarola.
01:40:11 You're a good hand.
01:40:16 This is Amanda Pryor, who comes from a legacy of community activists.
01:40:23 Her father, Harold Chestnut, has always been in my life, I feel like.
01:40:29 So thank you.
01:40:30 Thank you.
01:40:31 Ms. Adria Graham-Scott, with the City of Durham, who works really, really hard.
01:40:44 She and her husband are definitely community activists, both on the job and off the job.
01:40:50 So we thank you for you and your family for all that you do for the City of Durham.
01:40:57 Ms. Sarita Hill.
01:40:58 I met Miss Serena when she first came to Durham,
01:41:03 was Step Up Durham, and it has grown so much
01:41:06 under her leadership, and she's always been just so quiet,
01:41:10 just a quiet mover and shaker.
01:41:12 But thank you so much.
01:41:14 Thank you for all that you do.
01:41:18 Miss Brea Miller.
01:41:21 She's not here.
01:41:23 We give her thanks as well.
01:41:24 And I think, I can't remember what department she works for, but she's good.
01:41:31 She's in the county, right?
01:41:34 Ms. Angie Weiss Gamble.
01:41:37 Okay, thank you.
01:41:39 Give her a round of applause.
01:41:40 I'm going to hold Carmichael to the last because she's the leader of this.
01:41:47 Mr. Anthony Scott, BHA.
01:41:50 And it has been my pleasure to work with Mr. Scott.
01:41:55 You know, he brought to us—he participated in this initiative.
01:42:00 He also brought to us PERC.
01:42:01 You'll hear more about that later.
01:42:04 But—and all the groundbreakings.
01:42:06 He promised me a bunch of groundbreakings, and he has held to that promise.
01:42:12 Without you, a lot of the housing issues—a lot of the housing issues that we face would
01:42:18 be up here. But because of the diligence of you and your department, we see a lot of new
01:42:24 growth coming into that arena. So I appreciate you, Anthony.
01:42:28 Thank you. You've been so good in that arena.
01:42:35 Amber Wade. Amber has been such a part of this initiative even after moving on. She
01:42:42 Amber has been such a part of this initiative, even after moving on, she has maintained her
01:42:48 contacts with Durham City.
01:42:51 Thank you, Amber, for all that you've done and continue to do.
01:42:59 My sister, Judge.
01:43:00 Pat Evans, one of my best friends.
01:43:04 My BFF.
01:43:05 My BFF, we have walked, this is walked so many times,
01:43:10 so many years, what is it, about 40 years now, Pat?
01:43:13 1994.
01:43:14 It's going on.
01:43:14 But everywhere I am, there she is.
01:43:19 You always come here for me, 50.
01:43:21 I love you.
01:43:22 I love you.
01:43:23 Just ask.
01:43:24 Just ask.
01:43:24 It's Emma Zuback.
01:43:27 Emma is a Duke student who wrote me
01:43:31 when I first became mayor, said, I want to work with you.
01:43:35 I want to do something.
01:43:37 And so, Emma, I said, well, you know,
01:43:39 we have this little project going on that I'd like you
01:43:41 to be involved in.
01:43:43 And Emma participated.
01:43:45 So she's a great young lady.
01:43:48 She had a lot to offer.
01:43:50 And we wish you the best, Emma.
01:43:52 She's a great young lady.
01:43:54 So give her a round, y'all.
01:43:55 Probably in class.
01:43:56 Mr. Dennis Garrett, my one of my ride or die.
01:44:03 Now, he know the streets of Durham.
01:44:06 Now, he did not tell a story about that.
01:44:09 Love and respect over there on Andrew Avenue.
01:44:13 Dennis has been doing it in the community for a long time.
01:44:16 He's one of those people that I can call and say, Dennis, this is what's going on.
01:44:19 This is what I'm hearing.
01:44:21 Make something happen.
01:44:22 Make something happen.
01:44:23 And he does it.
01:44:24 He's responsible for bringing the reformers along with Judge Evans.
01:44:28 So we had firsthand information on how things really happen for those who cannot find housing.
01:44:37 And Dennis also has housing that he provides.
01:44:41 So thank you, my brother.
01:44:43 You always come through for me.
01:44:45 Who got a camera?
01:44:46 I want to take a picture with him.
01:44:47 Who got a camera?
01:44:48 This is a lady.
01:44:49 I'm in straight.
01:44:50 I want to act like I got you.
01:44:51 I don't want to act like I got you.
01:44:54 Charles, I know I'll get it.
01:44:59 Thank you.
01:45:01 I thank you for the opportunity.
01:45:02 Oh, I thank y'all.
01:45:04 Miss Stella Adams.
01:45:05 Everybody knows Stella Adams if you've been around
01:45:07 Durham and housing long enough.
01:45:08 So Stella was a participant in this to the best she could.
01:45:13 And we thank Stella for her hard work and dedication
01:45:16 over the city for years.
01:45:18 Steve Chalmers, my brother.
01:45:22 Steve and I go back to the West End.
01:45:26 We're church members.
01:45:28 His family, my family are very tight.
01:45:31 I can reveal all of that now.
01:45:35 So, you know, Steve, you always been in my life, you like.
01:45:39 So, and I can't think of a better role model
01:45:43 with him and Pat and Dennis,
01:45:45 of people who really know Durham, care about Durham,
01:45:50 and put their time in.
01:45:51 Steve been retired forever, but he's never been retired.
01:45:55 He's always been on the streets of Durham doing something.
01:45:58 So my brother, it is an honor for me to be able to say
01:46:03 that you are a part of my life.
01:46:05 You're a part of my life.
01:46:06 Appreciate your time.
01:46:07 Thank you.
01:46:10 And the lady that held it together for us,
01:46:12 Miss Kamesha Wallace.
01:46:14 Kamisha came into this arena and she's always willing and ready to lend a helping hand.
01:46:31 And this was no small feat.
01:46:33 She had to travel, they had to go to New York, and this is on top of all the millions of
01:46:38 things she does as chief of staff in the city, right?
01:46:43 So on top of that, you got a brand new mayor coming in and saying, can you give some more
01:46:48 time?
01:46:49 And it's a lot of time.
01:46:50 It's not a little bit of time.
01:46:52 And it's on this deep subject.
01:46:53 And it's not the sexy work that you won't get the accolades for.
01:46:58 You won't be on TV about it.
01:47:01 And she said, without hesitation, I got you, mayor.
01:47:05 So to my sister in the fight, thank you.
01:47:10 Thank you.
01:47:11 Thank you, Mayor.
01:47:12 We did it.
01:47:13 We got him through.
01:47:14 We did it.
01:47:15 We did it.
01:47:16 We did it.
01:47:17 So, can I get a picture?
01:47:18 And then I think Carmichael is going to lead the presentation and she's going to tell
01:47:25 you all what we have, what they did.
01:47:28 Yeah, we can come down here.
01:47:31 So proud of you.
01:47:34 I'm proud of him.
01:47:35 I'm proud of him.
01:47:36 I'm proud of him.
01:47:37 That mirror.
01:47:38 It should be a part of the line.
01:47:39 It should get a, it should get a.
01:47:40 He a broke, but life is good.
01:47:41 I'm proud of him.
01:47:42 I'm proud of him.
01:47:43 I'm proud of him.
01:47:44 I'm proud of him.
01:47:45 I'm proud of him.
01:47:46 I'm proud of him.
01:47:47 I'm proud of him.
01:47:48 I'm proud of him.
01:47:49 I'm proud of him.
01:47:50 I'm proud of him.
01:47:51 I'm proud of him.
01:47:52 I'm proud of him.
01:47:53 I'm proud of him.
01:47:54 I'm proud of him.
01:47:55 I'm proud of him.
01:47:56 I'm proud of him.
01:47:57 I'm proud of him.
01:47:58 I'm proud of him.
01:47:59 I'm proud of him.
01:48:00 I'm proud of him.
01:48:31 write this.
01:49:01 Good afternoon, Madam Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem Middleton, members of the Durham City Council.
01:49:15 My name is Carmicia Wallace.
01:49:17 I am in the city manager's office and I am delighted to be before you today to share
01:49:24 with you the great work.
01:49:25 And Mayor, I want to appreciate you for allowing, I want to personally thank you for allowing
01:49:31 me the opportunity to serve on this journey with you.
01:49:37 I appreciate the fact that you were courageous
01:49:40 and brave enough to do what you often refer to
01:49:43 as pioneering work.
01:49:45 You were absolutely right, this was a lot of work
01:49:47 on top of what we all, those of us who are not
01:49:50 retired anymore but are doing other things,
01:49:54 doing it in addition to.
01:49:56 So I won't be before you long.
01:50:00 I am tag teaming today with Colin Davis from the Community Development Department.
01:50:07 Colin and I actually coordinated our outfits.
01:50:09 He didn't know that, but we did.
01:50:11 So that's just how much time we spent together.
01:50:15 Bloomberg required a time commitment.
01:50:18 They did not provide financial resources to us, but they did provide a resource that I
01:50:24 will share with you a little bit more.
01:50:26 I do want to point out for the viewing audience, Bloomberg financed the work.
01:50:31 So when the mayor talks about travel, it was at Bloomberg's expense.
01:50:36 So I want to be very clear about that.
01:50:38 So this was an excellent opportunity for us.
01:50:40 I will be advancing through the slides today.
01:50:44 So you'll see some of the pictures that we captured throughout this journey.
01:50:49 Let's see.
01:50:55 So Mayor spoke on this a little bit, but I'm going to share this for others just to make
01:51:00 sure you hear this.
01:51:03 I should have sound here.
01:51:17 We did test this.
01:51:25 All right, I'm going to keep it moving.
01:51:27 But this, oh, he paused.
01:51:35 I'll come back to this.
01:51:38 Oh, you think it's my computer?
01:51:39 Okay.
01:51:55 I'll try again.
01:52:00 Hello, everyone.
01:52:01 I am
01:52:04 great to see you in the United States.
01:52:13 Hello, everyone.
01:52:15 I am
01:52:18 great to see you in the United States.
01:52:21 I am
01:52:23 excited.
01:52:25 and now our busy day to join our routine
01:52:30 as we work together to solve.
01:52:36 I've been a city mayor now for a little over a year and a half.
01:52:41 It's my mission to help make Durham a great place to live,
01:52:46 to play, and to grow.
01:52:47 So, because of sound quality,
01:52:51 it's not what I would like for it to be.
01:52:53 That is a video that Mayor O'Neill provided
01:52:59 for the group of participants involved in this work.
01:53:06 Mayor has acknowledged our core team members,
01:53:09 but just so that you can see the names,
01:53:11 Stella Adams was representing in Poverty Durham.
01:53:14 She was not able to join us today.
01:53:17 Steve Chalmers with Hayti Reborn.
01:53:19 Did I get that right, Chalmers?
01:53:21 That's right, Haitai Reborn Justice Movement,
01:53:24 along with retired District Court Judge Pat Evans,
01:53:27 who you heard earlier today or saw,
01:53:30 Angie Weiss Gamble was with Duke,
01:53:33 and Dennis Garrett, love and respect,
01:53:35 Serita Hill, Step Up Durham,
01:53:37 LaManda Pryor with Represented Partners Against Crime
01:53:40 at that time, along with Emma Zuback
01:53:44 that the mayor referenced.
01:53:45 Bria Miller was not able to join us today.
01:53:48 She's a staff at Durham County,
01:53:50 Partnership for a Healthy Durham, Rashauna Parker,
01:53:52 you heard that actually the organization's name,
01:53:56 department's name has changed
01:53:57 to Justice Services Department.
01:53:59 Colin is a city employee,
01:54:02 myself, Adrian Graham Scott from OEWD,
01:54:05 but I wanna give an extra shout out to Amber Wade,
01:54:08 who was our project manager,
01:54:09 who Amber was the taskmaster for us
01:54:12 in keeping things going throughout this process.
01:54:14 So definitely a big shout out to Amber.
01:54:18 Also on the Zoom call today is Stephanie Wade.
01:54:23 Stephanie is our coach from Bloomberg.
01:54:25 Stephanie, if you're able to unmute yourself
01:54:28 and turn your screen on so we can recognize you as well.
01:54:34 Hi, everyone.
01:54:35 Thank you so much for including me today.
01:54:37 It's absolutely thrilling to see everybody
01:54:41 getting recognized for the incredible hard work,
01:54:44 which I think is completely understated
01:54:47 how hard this team had to work over the course of nine months,
01:54:51 five to 10 hours a week additional on top of their already demanding jobs
01:54:56 to really move this work forward to apply
01:55:00 innovation to uncover some opportunities that the city has to improve
01:55:06 lives for these justice involved individuals. So I'm just so proud of
01:55:09 everyone. I want to thank you again for your hard
01:55:12 work and so excited to celebrate you and Mayor thank you so
01:55:16 much for your participation, your dedication, your passion and support of
01:55:20 this incredible work. So thank you all so much for having me.
01:55:24 Thank you Stephanie. So Stephanie was provided to us by Bloomberg
01:55:32 Philanthropies as the mayor noted and so Stephanie was our coach throughout
01:55:36 the process. Mayor O'Neill also had a coach that was specific to the mayor. I
01:55:42 I will point out with the Bloomberg work,
01:55:44 it forces members of the community,
01:55:50 core team members to think about things differently.
01:55:54 As has been mentioned, we had weekly coaching sessions.
01:55:56 Stephanie has gone all around the world
01:55:59 as part of her work with Bloomberg,
01:56:01 so many of our coaching sessions were virtual.
01:56:03 We also had some in-person coaching sessions.
01:56:06 She did conduct some site visits here in Durham.
01:56:09 We actually had classes,
01:56:10 and the classes were virtual classes with Harvard University.
01:56:14 So, when we talk about the time commitment,
01:56:16 there were times where we were responsible
01:56:17 for doing homework to prepare for the class,
01:56:19 then take the class, and then homework after the class.
01:56:22 And then, we also had to meet with one another,
01:56:26 meet with members of the community,
01:56:29 get feedback from members of the community,
01:56:31 meeting with the staff,
01:56:32 meeting with Stephanie as the coach,
01:56:36 stakeholder interviews, which you will hear more about.
01:56:38 So, the stakeholder interviews were conducted
01:56:40 via telephone and many were in person as well.
01:56:44 So at this point I'm going to turn it over to Colin
01:56:47 who's going to give you a little bit more detail
01:56:49 about the stakeholder interviews.
01:56:51 I will say that in light of the problem or the challenge
01:56:55 that Mayor O'Neill wanted us to do a deeper dive into,
01:56:59 we identified three different stakeholder groups.
01:57:02 And so Colin will walk you through the feedback
01:57:05 that we got through the interview process
01:57:07 with the respective stakeholder groups.
01:57:08 Colin?
01:57:09 Sure.
01:57:12 Good afternoon, Mayor, City Manager, Council Members.
01:57:15 I'm Colin Davis with the Community Development Department.
01:57:19 We did stakeholder interviews with three key groups, those who were identified as justice involved,
01:57:26 landlords, and service providers, and we learned a lot from each of those groups.
01:57:31 And we captured several of the direct quotes in these slides,
01:57:38 And to sum up some of the things we heard from the justice involved was putting people
01:57:43 into housing without having the skill sets there to maintain the housing isn't helpful
01:57:48 to solving any problems if you don't know how to manage it, save money,
01:57:53 and being able to have their credit fixed.
01:57:56 This was something that came from somebody who's justice involved saying,
01:57:59 just don't throw me in a house without giving me some tools to maintain it.
01:58:03 The other thing that was fascinating was the feeling that landlords have one bad experience
01:58:11 and a bias forms and it's taken out on the next person who has a similar background,
01:58:17 assuming that that person is going to follow the exact same path.
01:58:21 And that was hard to hear.
01:58:23 It's hard to hear when people are feeling that they're seen in a way that is not necessarily going to be true for them.
01:58:31 And then the other piece is all landlords require application fees.
01:58:36 And those fees, the landlord keeps whether you're accepted for housing or not.
01:58:41 And when you don't have a whole lot of money and you're applying for multiple apartments, it gets incredibly difficult and
01:58:47 incredibly expensive to keep applying and keep being told no over and over and over again.
01:58:51 Where you become just disheartened and almost give up.
01:58:55 We move over to the landlords and what they were telling us is the market in Durham is great.
01:59:03 I mean, look at the businesses coming here.
01:59:06 We don't need to take vouchers.
01:59:07 We don't need to take people with less than stellar credit.
01:59:11 We have plenty of people willing to rent at high rates.
01:59:14 We have plenty of people that we can rent to.
01:59:17 So why would we change our pieces to help?
01:59:22 We want to help, but there's not a need to work and take vouchers at this point in time.
01:59:28 And even when there's safety issues that are brought up or lease violations,
01:59:33 landlords are saying it takes a very, very long time to repair that situation,
01:59:39 to go through an eviction, to get through that process.
01:59:42 And because of that, there's a hesitancy to take anybody with barriers.
01:59:48 Because if something goes wrong, not that it will, but if it does,
01:59:53 it's a very long legal process to get through that at this point in Durham.
01:59:59 When we talk about our service providers, there was a lot of feedback about the systems working in silos.
02:00:08 And they're not easy to follow, they're hard to access,
02:00:13 because there isn't a cohesive coordinated system,
02:00:18 there isn't a one-stop shop, if you will.
02:00:20 There was a discussion about how the homeless system
02:00:23 is a coordinated entry.
02:00:25 If you're experiencing homelessness,
02:00:26 there's one phone number and you're routed,
02:00:28 and the justice involved, there isn't that one number
02:00:32 that you call and get routed.
02:00:33 If you're justice involved, you might call homelessness
02:00:35 and you might call somewhere else.
02:00:38 So those are the highlights of these that I wanted to share,
02:00:41 I'm going to turn it over to my esteemed colleague, Mr. Dennis Garrett,
02:00:46 to talk about some of the themes and insights for further exploration.
02:00:50 Dennis.
02:00:53 So again, I want to say thank you for the opportunity.
02:00:55 We talked about the trust between the landlords and the tenants, right?
02:01:03 And then we was talking about the support system.
02:01:09 we got a whole lot of different agencies that's not working hand to hand.
02:01:15 Again, I keep talking about that personality getting in the way of the principle.
02:01:20 The principle is that we got these JII's that's coming in.
02:01:24 And like Colin was talking about earlier, how the landlords are saying, well,
02:01:29 we got this group, so we don't need this group, and we don't have to work with that group.
02:01:33 But Judge Evans has a very dear friend or a very dear individual, Leah Berkman.
02:01:40 Nobody said that.
02:01:41 I want to put her name out there because there were some individuals that was straight out of penitentiary,
02:01:48 straight off the streets, wanted to change their life, and Leah gave them an opportunity.
02:01:53 And Steve Chalmers and, you know, maybe I'm off topic, but this is personal to me, so I might slip, right?
02:02:02 because I am a J. I. I'm a dope theme bum. Okay, judge, I can say that today.
02:02:08 She don't like me say that. But you guys, what we're trying to do is get
02:02:11 y'all to understand that people like us do get an opportunity to change and we
02:02:15 can't change without the proper equipment. Like the chief was saying
02:02:21 that, you know, we got people that can do some stuff and say some stuff. But
02:02:25 are we implementing their stuff? We can stand up here and talk forever and you
02:02:29 You guys can act like you're interested,
02:02:31 and you can be bored.
02:02:33 But the attention is the crime in the streets.
02:02:36 And how do we change it with the JII and the housing?
02:02:42 Come on, help me, Comicia.
02:02:43 OK.
02:02:43 So the mayor challenged us as a group.
02:02:47 And she said that she wanted us to come together and can come up
02:02:52 with a support system that will help the individuals coming out
02:02:55 of low-income development, housing, prison, jail,
02:03:00 drugs, mental health, all of that play a part
02:03:03 of that not being able to maintain an atmosphere
02:03:08 of somewhere to live.
02:03:09 Or even how to talk to somebody to find somewhere to live.
02:03:12 So the mayor gave us a challenge to come up
02:03:16 with affordable housing and intervention from the streets.
02:03:20 Can I talk my language?
02:03:21 I don't know y'all language.
02:03:23 To do something different, how we can do something different.
02:03:25 That was our challenge.
02:03:26 So, Commissioner is pushing me, so the lack of accessibility,
02:03:33 like we started with the lack of accessibility
02:03:36 and the decent housing.
02:03:37 But now we at a place where there's
02:03:40 some collaboration going on, right?
02:03:43 See, y'all call that downtown re-justification.
02:03:46 We call it relocation, because we
02:03:48 are pushing out those that don't have nowhere to go already.
02:03:53 My personal observation anyway, come on, come is you have now
02:03:56 have now have.
02:03:58 So the sessions that we know from May to June we had a lot of
02:04:03 different participants that came in. We all had different
02:04:07 groups where we went out and we interviewed different
02:04:10 individuals and different groups.
02:04:13 Like judge Evans and I had the the the
02:04:17 criminals and Steve and them had the housing component and
02:04:22 and Anthony Scott left but he played a significant part as well. But what we did
02:04:28 is we built information to come back and tell you what it'll take to help those
02:04:33 JII's. Like not just say well they need a house, they need a job, they need we
02:04:39 already know they need that how can we give it to them right. So the one-stop
02:04:43 shop model is what we kind of like leaning toward because you can go to one place and
02:04:49 get everything that you need to make you holistic.
02:04:52 Right?
02:04:53 So, with that being said, though, one of the other things we talked about was the peer
02:04:59 support specialist.
02:05:01 And or whatever title you want to call it, what that is is an individual that will come
02:05:05 in for me and help me to fill out an application.
02:05:09 And then once I get the house, it'll help me be eligible to pay my bills and show me—like,
02:05:15 to keep me from being evicted.
02:05:17 To keep me—to show me how to maintain, because some things I don't know how to do.
02:05:23 Like I might not even know how to fill out an application.
02:05:25 So the peer support specialist will be the go-between, the landlord and the individual
02:05:32 to keep them on one accord.
02:05:34 And with that being said, there's some other issues
02:05:37 that got in the way.
02:05:39 I'm kind of ahead of myself, but.
02:05:42 You on Colin's lives, man.
02:05:43 You've covered three of Colin's lives.
02:05:44 I'm on Colin's lives.
02:05:45 Well, come on here, Colin.
02:05:47 But anyway, I want you guys to hear what I'm saying, right?
02:05:52 And not just hear what I'm saying,
02:05:53 but try to listen to what's being said.
02:05:56 And what I'm saying is like people like me,
02:05:58 without a person like you, Mayor, believing in me, you know?
02:06:02 And I want to throw a hand out there to Miss Paige, too,
02:06:06 because she seen me out there when I was a knucklehead.
02:06:10 So people like y'all that believed in somebody like me,
02:06:13 that's all them guys is asking for, them JIIs,
02:06:16 is for somebody to believe in them
02:06:19 and give them more than just a sentence, a word,
02:06:23 but an opportunity.
02:06:26 So I'm asking y'all to follow up on whatever
02:06:28 the mayor has started.
02:06:30 Like this certificate, they ain't going to do nothing for me.
02:06:32 They ain't going to pay no bills.
02:06:33 But what it's going to do is it's
02:06:34 going to give me some incentive to continue
02:06:36 working with this group of unique individuals
02:06:41 and this group of individuals.
02:06:43 Because I met these people.
02:06:45 I'm off topic, but I'm sorry.
02:06:46 But I met these people that I would never have dealt with.
02:06:49 I would have never been able to deal with Judge Evans.
02:06:52 I stand in front of the judge, and she say,
02:06:54 you're in the Department of Corrections.
02:06:56 But now I get to stand beside her.
02:06:58 Like, for real, I get to hang out
02:06:59 with the Chief, Steve Chalmers, and Colin.
02:07:02 Like, you guys, this has given me an opportunity,
02:07:06 as a JNI, to have hope for the streets
02:07:10 so I can go out and say, well, this is what they did for me,
02:07:13 and they can see it, and now they're willing
02:07:16 to have something done for them.
02:07:18 But if we don't deliver, all we're doing
02:07:20 is like contributing to the, I'm getting personal.
02:07:24 Okay, go ahead.
02:07:25 So part of our method to seeking input, we used a variety of stakeholder techniques.
02:07:41 We didn't just have listening sessions where people talked at us or we threw out questions,
02:07:46 we didn't do surveys.
02:07:47 We used idea cards where we'd have something like a picture of Chick-fil-A or a picture
02:07:52 of something and tell us what you think about this or if you were going to solve a problem,
02:07:57 how would, if you were, you know, Microsoft, how would Microsoft solve this problem?
02:08:03 It came up with creative ways for people to start thinking in different ways of solving
02:08:07 problems like Amazon.
02:08:09 How would Amazon handle this situation?
02:08:10 It's like, well, we would do it by this.
02:08:12 So we did that.
02:08:13 We did storyboarding, which is sort of a fancy way of saying basically like a comic strip.
02:08:18 We kind of drew these things out in little comics to help map out things to get input from stakeholders
02:08:24 to see how they would think and challenge people to think outside the box.
02:08:29 Next slide.
02:08:31 We had some additional ideas.
02:08:32 Do you want to take this?
02:08:33 Yeah.
02:08:34 Okay. So I'm back on track now.
02:08:37 Okay. Good.
02:08:38 Okay. So the Bloomberg has given us an additional 20 hours, right?
02:08:46 So to fall in some other things that we didn't have a chance
02:08:50 to collaborate on.
02:08:52 But some things that stand out is like,
02:08:54 number eight is engaging with the legal aid.
02:08:57 Like we got a JII that's living in an apartment
02:09:00 and the landlord has given us a chance
02:09:02 to give him an apartment.
02:09:03 Then the legal aid will come in and divert them
02:09:06 from paying their bills because of the, whatever.
02:09:11 So instead of them helping us to give the JII a place,
02:09:18 they give the JII an excuse to not pay the bills.
02:09:21 That's where the peer support specialists come in
02:09:23 and we don't use excuses, we get solutions, right?
02:09:27 I hope I'm saying something y'all understand.
02:09:29 And then to pursue the landlords
02:09:33 that will give us JII's an opportunity, right?
02:09:37 So, like Steve and I and the Bloomberg,
02:09:42 we're talking about like starting in this place with Leah,
02:09:46 and then you reach a tier and you move into another place.
02:09:50 So when they move out of that space,
02:09:51 somebody else can move in this place.
02:09:54 So we gotta continue with them 20 hours
02:09:57 that Bloomberg has given us with the new team.
02:10:01 So when the mayor leaves, he ain't really going nowhere.
02:10:03 When the mayor leave, we'll still be able to pursue
02:10:06 how we can take these people off the streets,
02:10:10 get to, because if you ain't got nowhere to live,
02:10:12 then the poverty ain't just in your surroundings,
02:10:16 it's in your mind, and now we gotta change.
02:10:20 So, commission keep looking at me with them funny things.
02:10:24 So, I'm gonna let Collin come back up here.
02:10:27 So actually, I wanna thank Dennis,
02:10:32 Because this core team spent a lot of time together,
02:10:37 we have developed relationships,
02:10:39 and in many cases, our paths were already crossed,
02:10:43 and in some cases, they had not.
02:10:45 So we spent a lot of time working together,
02:10:47 laughing together, we've had some very
02:10:49 interesting conversations, but I wanna acknowledge
02:10:52 you, Dennis, for the work that you do day to day,
02:10:56 day to day, that doesn't occur inside this council chamber,
02:10:59 that's not always on TV.
02:11:02 But I also want to acknowledge that Dennis,
02:11:04 along with Judge Evans and some others,
02:11:06 including Haitai Reborn staff, which includes LaManda
02:11:10 and Chief Chalmers, were able to bring the justice involved
02:11:15 individuals.
02:11:16 So when Dennis talks about JII, justice involved
02:11:19 or justice impacted individuals, to the conversation.
02:11:23 So Bloomberg, I refer to it as being Bloomberged.
02:11:26 When you've been Bloomberged, then it
02:11:28 It forces you to not look at old problems
02:11:32 the same way that you've been looking at them,
02:11:34 particularly if you want a different result
02:11:36 or a different outcome.
02:11:37 So this, and I have to acknowledge that Durham
02:11:40 as an organization and as a community
02:11:42 is not afraid to try different things.
02:11:45 And so we were forced to have
02:11:50 just as involved individuals at the table.
02:11:52 And Dennis played a key part
02:11:54 in getting just as involved individuals to the table,
02:11:57 different races, different genders.
02:11:59 They participate in every session that we had.
02:12:02 They were represented there.
02:12:04 They were able to bring in some service providers as well.
02:12:07 So their voices are the ones that informed the ideas
02:12:10 that you saw on the slide.
02:12:12 So there were 10 ideas total that the community shared
02:12:17 with us and the core team had.
02:12:19 We tested two.
02:12:20 Bloomberg work requires that you do a prototyping
02:12:23 and a testing.
02:12:24 So we went through that process.
02:12:25 we do have some other ideas that we have not tested.
02:12:29 Dennis made reference to 20 hours.
02:12:31 So, we applied for and were awarded
02:12:34 20 additional hours of coaching.
02:12:36 And so, we had a little break in between there,
02:12:37 but I guess we're getting ready to gird our loins
02:12:39 and go, you know, continue in the next phase of this work.
02:12:43 So, Collin, I don't know if you had anything else
02:12:46 that you wanted to add.
02:12:48 Dennis covered pretty much all of our slides.
02:12:51 So we really don't have much more to add.
02:12:56 I definitely want to thank the core team again
02:13:00 for the work, for your time, for your contributions.
02:13:03 I had one last slot that has a picture
02:13:06 of the mayor's coach.
02:13:09 Mayor, I don't remember your coach's name here.
02:13:12 Terrence.
02:13:14 So this young man on the far left was the mayor's coach.
02:13:17 And this is not everybody on the core team.
02:13:20 and you will see in the background a screen.
02:13:23 We use the water management facility,
02:13:26 but Bloomberg introduced many of us
02:13:28 to something called a Miro board.
02:13:31 So the sound effects that you're hearing from the audience
02:13:34 is indication that Miro board is not Microsoft Word.
02:13:38 It's a little bit beyond that,
02:13:39 but Amber was a Miro board expert
02:13:42 and we were required to engage one another
02:13:45 by way of the Miro board.
02:13:46 And so it was new for us.
02:13:48 So this really got all of us out of our comfort zone.
02:13:50 So again, Mayor, I wanna thank you for the opportunity.
02:13:54 I wanna thank staff, Colin and Adria,
02:13:57 and used to be Amber for your fortitude
02:14:00 and sticking with this.
02:14:02 But more importantly to the community,
02:14:04 of course, the staff, it's our job
02:14:06 and we're committed to making it happen
02:14:08 and we wanna do our best work.
02:14:09 And I'm really looking forward,
02:14:11 many of the people that are here today
02:14:13 have agreed to continue forward
02:14:14 in the next phase of the work.
02:14:16 So we're looking forward to that.
02:14:18 Thank you so much.
02:14:20 Any questions, anybody?
02:14:21 Thank you, Madam Mayor.
02:14:30 I appreciate the presentation and Dennis for the work that you've all done.
02:14:37 I know that this is just a small piece of what came out of it, and so I look forward
02:14:43 to hear more as we continue on and just knowing that the legacy of our mayor, because she
02:14:58 is Esther, it has been incredibly hard to process and all of the love and kindness that
02:15:06 she shares is not reciprocated in the same way.
02:15:10 And I hope that she does get to see this come to fruition
02:15:15 because it is the work that she has poured in over 30 years in
02:15:19 the city and county.
02:15:22 And it is incredibly hard to sit here and pretend as if this
02:15:29 couldn't be more or pretend as if it would be.
02:15:32 I know that there was a lot of barriers and
02:15:37 I'm hopeful that those barriers will be removed as we move forward.
02:15:43 Otherwise, I know that I know how to turn over some tables and
02:15:48 I will be doing that to make sure that we continue this work.
02:15:51 So I'm just going to hope that we don't have to do that.
02:15:54 Thank you.
02:15:57 Mayor Pro Tem.
02:15:59 Thank you, Madam Mayor, so much.
02:16:01 Firstly, Brother Dennis, the line I went from standing in front of the judge to standing next to the judge,
02:16:07 may be the sound bite of the day, if not the mom.
02:16:11 What a beautiful sentiment.
02:16:13 You a poet and don't even know it.
02:16:14 Bars.
02:16:17 Madam Mayor, I want to thank you for your involvement in the Bloomberg initiative.
02:16:23 One of the things I've noticed, there's a certain swagger to mayors that have participated in the Bloomberg initiative.
02:16:30 I mean, they're all impressive people,
02:16:32 but there's a qualitative difference
02:16:34 that I've noticed at different conferences
02:16:36 around the country.
02:16:37 Those mayors that have participated
02:16:38 in the Bloomberg Initiative,
02:16:40 when they speak and when they engage in sessions,
02:16:44 you can tell that they've had some stuff exposed
02:16:48 and they've been exposed and their analysis is deeper,
02:16:52 their perspective is just different.
02:16:54 So I wanna congratulate you and thank you so much, man,
02:16:56 for continuing that tradition
02:16:57 and put a little pressure on his honor and waiting.
02:16:59 I hope that he will lean in as much with the Bloomberg possibilities and
02:17:05 potentialities as this mayor has done, and such an impressive group of folk.
02:17:10 I want to shout out Amber Wade in particular because she was absolutely instrumental,
02:17:16 and this is organic to what I want to say, in our work with guaranteed income,
02:17:21 which focused on justice involved individuals, and Sarita Hill as well.
02:17:26 And I guess, Madam Chief, thank you so much for your presentation.
02:17:29 My question is, what are the policy on ramps for the council to build upon this work?
02:17:35 I think guaranteed income is an organic on ramp there with our focus on justice involved individuals.
02:17:41 That's policy that we've done.
02:17:43 And I want to thank my colleagues for including $1 million in this last budget to continue our work with guaranteed income focused on justice involved individuals.
02:17:51 What are the, and I see some of the ideas, but as you see it, Madam Chief, or maybe anyone else,
02:17:56 What are the things that we can, we got a new budget cycle we're going to be starting soon,
02:18:01 that can concretize this work as a council to build, I don't want this to just be a report on the shelf.
02:18:08 What does that look like in your assessment moving forward?
02:18:12 So since the ideas were shared with the core team,
02:18:19 we did a presentation, the core team did a presentation to the mayor and city manager in July.
02:18:25 And so we did take a little break from the Bloomberg work,
02:18:29 but the city manager and I have been in conversation around
02:18:32 of the ideas, what are some of the low hanging fruit?
02:18:35 And we have worked to identify some of those things.
02:18:38 Collin is involved with the homeless services systems.
02:18:42 And so many of the barriers that justice involved,
02:18:46 individuals encounter,
02:18:48 homeless individuals and families also encounter.
02:18:52 So we've identified some of the ideas
02:18:55 that you saw on the screen that we can certainly connect
02:18:58 with the work that Colin is doing already.
02:19:00 Our relationship, the city's relationship with legal aid,
02:19:03 that's an easy on ramp for us
02:19:05 because we heard from landlords,
02:19:08 some of what their experience is with legal aid.
02:19:12 We also heard from justice involved and service providers.
02:19:15 So there are a couple of areas,
02:19:16 we've already begun that work to identify
02:19:18 what are the areas that we feel like are easiest to tackle,
02:19:21 But then what are some of the areas that are going to take additional work?
02:19:26 We're not shying away from any of them, but recognizing that most of them will require
02:19:32 partnership beyond the city.
02:19:34 Many of the ideas involve nonprofits, service providers, Durham County as well.
02:19:41 So we're certainly working through that process.
02:19:44 And then the 20 hours of coaching, that's what we're going to drill down some more with
02:19:48 our coach Stephanie to help sort through what are the things that we can tackle
02:19:52 and what's going to be the strategy for going after them. Right well this is
02:19:56 where rubber meets the road type work and certainly exploiting the enormous
02:20:00 resources that Bloomberg brings to the table I think is just a win for our city
02:20:04 and I'm excited about doing the policy work putting some some meat on the bones
02:20:09 of this remarkable work you're doing so thank you so much for the work your
02:20:13 honor thank you so much ma'am for leaning in on this and I look forward to
02:20:16 continuing of the legacy to Councilmember Freeman's point. This is I
02:20:21 think why many of us ran for office this type of stuff this type of work and we
02:20:24 will definitely be looking at policy on ramps for this work it will not be
02:20:28 abstract. Thank you so much. Thank you Madam Mayor.
02:20:31 Mayor Pro Tem, Councilman Williams. Thank you Madam Mayor, thank you colleagues.
02:20:36 You know when when we have our votes and we go the opposite direction up here
02:20:42 with the 4-3, a lot of folks create a narrative about it,
02:20:46 and people talk about that or whatever.
02:20:49 But behind the scenes, you know, we have these relationships,
02:20:53 and coming up really soon,
02:20:56 Mayor O'Neill and I will be sitting down,
02:20:58 having a conversation,
02:20:59 and one of the first things she said to me was,
02:21:02 "'All right, baby.
02:21:03 "'Now listen, this Bloomberg stuff is really good,
02:21:06 "'and you're gonna have to make sure you take it home,
02:21:08 "'all of it.'"
02:21:10 And I was like, well, absolutely.
02:21:12 So I'll tell you that little segment to let you know that this is a continuation.
02:21:16 It's comprehensive.
02:21:17 This isn't where, you know, we stop everything that's happening and we start something new.
02:21:23 I mean, yeah, I have ideas.
02:21:24 There are going to be council members that have ideas.
02:21:26 But I think it's really fair to say that our ideas are going to be building on one another.
02:21:33 So the folks that are involved don't get comfortable because you're going to still have to work.
02:21:39 and you'll have folks joining you with that.
02:21:41 So as a matter of fact,
02:21:47 I get sworn in on December 4th.
02:21:49 December 5th, the next morning, I fly to Harvard
02:21:52 and I'm there all day Tuesday and Wednesday
02:21:55 and then Thursday morning I fly back for the work session.
02:21:59 That is how soon, actually my first task as the next mayor
02:22:02 will be continuing this type of work
02:22:04 with the Bloomberg Association
02:22:06 and the new Mayor's Association.
02:22:08 So I love Mayor O'Neill and a vote is a vote,
02:22:13 but it takes a lot to stand on this dais
02:22:16 and take the punches every which way they come.
02:22:20 But at the end of the day, we are a team
02:22:23 and we're the team running the city.
02:22:26 So I just appreciate the work that you all have done.
02:22:30 It gave me goosebumps to hear you say that, Dennis.
02:22:34 I used to stand before the mayor
02:22:36 and now I stand beside her.
02:22:37 That is the evolution that we're thriving for.
02:22:41 That is it.
02:22:42 That is what we're shooting for.
02:22:43 We're making sure that we are building relationships
02:22:46 to where we make each other stronger.
02:22:49 And that foundation we're standing on
02:22:50 are the mistakes that we've made
02:22:52 and the mistakes that we've learned from.
02:22:54 So we can convert those into lessons.
02:22:56 And we have a lot of work to do.
02:22:59 And I look forward to continuing it.
02:23:00 This is good work.
02:23:02 Thank you.
02:23:05 Thank you all so much, you know,
02:23:06 for this pioneering effort, and I know Leo will continue it.
02:23:11 He's going to enjoy himself and all of the knowledge
02:23:13 at Harvard.
02:23:15 They have a lot of resources that they give to a city,
02:23:19 and they basically tell you, we will give you
02:23:21 as much as you want.
02:23:23 They have that kind of open door policy
02:23:26 with all of their expertise.
02:23:28 And so I am so grateful for the pioneering work
02:23:32 that you all have done.
02:23:33 I had hoped to be able to leave just pieces and tools that you can pull together.
02:23:39 So the housing deep dive was one of them.
02:23:41 This piece is one of them.
02:23:43 The last piece that I hoped to do that we didn't get a chance to do was to do a roll
02:23:47 call of all non-profits.
02:23:49 That's where you get a lot of your volunteers for.
02:23:52 And the city government and all of our workers, we have a lot of bandwidth, but we don't have
02:23:57 that type of bandwidth.
02:23:59 And so the last piece that I hope to try to be involved is, is to figure out who's doing
02:24:05 what where across the city.
02:24:07 And then with the other pieces, the housing deep dive, all of the good work that the community
02:24:12 safety department is doing, we can begin to integrate it so that our policy makers have
02:24:17 a clear picture of what the state of the city kind of looks like at an up close level.
02:24:23 A lot of times we don't know actually what's going on
02:24:27 in the streets unless you're out there making it happen.
02:24:31 And I've missed that space,
02:24:33 so I'm gonna go return to that space,
02:24:35 but there's a disconnect a lot of times.
02:24:37 So I think these pieces kind of bring it together
02:24:40 and give you a foundation for this city to build upon
02:24:43 to help our most vulnerable populations
02:24:45 be able to live, work, and play.
02:24:47 So thank you all for being a part of that.
02:24:49 I'm so glad you all have 20 extra hours.
02:24:52 Oh, man.
02:24:53 So keep me posted on what's going on.
02:24:55 Thanks, Commisha.
02:24:56 I really appreciate you for all the work,
02:24:58 and Amber, and all of the whole team.
02:25:00 Thanks so much, everybody.
02:25:02 Thank you.
02:25:03 Can I leave you with one last thought?
02:25:05 You were talking about the nonprofit organizations.
02:25:07 Sometimes, like, nonprofit organizations
02:25:10 don't have the ability to maintain their status
02:25:13 because they don't file taxes.
02:25:15 Or you don't file in a certain amount of time.
02:25:18 It don't mean that you're not doing the work.
02:25:19 It means you didn't have nobody to help you do the work.
02:25:22 So I really want y'all to take a look at the funding, who you fund, do they got to have,
02:25:29 you know, certain, you know, like teach them how to get and how to stay.
02:25:34 Because the work is being done, just the title says something different.
02:25:38 I want y'all to hear me say that.
02:25:40 And that's so important because a lot of times that is where we miss a lot of it, Dennis,
02:25:45 is that a lot of people run and they do a lot of the volunteer work, but because of
02:25:49 the structures that you have to put in place to actually have a nonprofit, that in itself
02:25:54 is a barrier.
02:25:55 So and that's some of the areas that we can work on, especially if you figure out who
02:25:59 your nonprofits are that have done that successfully, you can begin to build some partnerships and
02:26:04 help folks navigate how you get over those barriers.
02:26:07 So thank you for bringing that point out.
02:26:09 This is important.
02:26:10 A lot of people are doing the work, but they might not necessarily have the strongest administrative
02:26:14 staff, but they know the streets are Durham.
02:26:17 And so there's value in that and we have to make sure that those who are doing that actually
02:26:22 have the support to get the work done.
02:26:25 And that lack of administrative capacity doesn't become an impediment, which a lot of times
02:26:30 it is.
02:26:31 So thank you for bringing it up.
02:26:32 Thank you all.
02:26:33 All right, thanks.
02:26:34 And we will now turn to our first quarter financial report.
02:26:41 Ms. Rielden.
02:26:42 Item 22.
02:26:43 Item 22.
02:26:59 Okay, good afternoon, Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, and members of council.
02:27:03 Christina Reardon with Budget and Management Services.
02:27:06 And I am here today to provide you with our first quarter financial report, which is a
02:27:11 report that we provide you four times a year with and prepare in partnership with our colleagues
02:27:17 in finance.
02:27:21 Just some reminders, this financial report happens very early in the fiscal year, and
02:27:28 so there's still a lot of uncertainty that exists.
02:27:33 And so I'll be talking a little bit about that today.
02:27:35 And then also, as a reminder, I will be back in front of you in February to do our second
02:27:42 quarter report.
02:27:43 At that time I'll have half a year's worth of data, which it will also be right in the
02:27:49 middle of our budget season as well, too.
02:27:54 So I wanted to start out our financial report as I often, as I always do with our general
02:28:00 fund, which as you are aware is the fund where most of our departments sit.
02:28:05 A few reminders about some of the numbers I'm going to show you today. Again, this is still
02:28:13 our first quarter. It's early in the fiscal year. We only have three months worth of data. Some
02:28:21 things that I wanted to point out, which is as you know, our general fund, the two major revenue
02:28:27 sources in that fund are our property tax, which makes up about 50% of the
02:28:31 general fund budget, and then sales tax. Property tax bills were not mailed out
02:28:38 during the first quarter this year, so we do not have, you'll
02:28:43 notice that when I go through the revenue slides, so we do not have a lot
02:28:46 of data on that as well too when we're making projections. And most of that
02:28:51 property tax comes in in December and January when tax bills are due, but this
02:28:56 year the bills are mailed out a little later. Also our first sales tax payment
02:29:02 does not we do not receive that until October because sales tax is on a
02:29:08 three-month delay. At this point we do have two months of sales tax. It is still
02:29:15 early and with only two months we are down slightly from where we were last
02:29:20 year at this time. We had collected about 14 million last year at this time and we
02:29:26 We have collected about $13 million at this point.
02:29:30 It is not something that we are necessarily overly concerned about, but it's something that we will be monitoring as the fiscal year goes forward.
02:29:39 So this slide kind of just shows you kind of
02:29:45 some really general information about the revenue sources in the general fund.
02:29:51 The first is property tax, and as I explained, this is down significantly.
02:29:56 About almost 89% and that is because those tax bills went out so late
02:30:03 We are not concerned that there is a problem at this point with our revenue in the property tax
02:30:09 collection
02:30:11 Occupancy tax is there is good news with that. It is up almost 40% from where we were last year at this time
02:30:18 Our Powell bill which is the money we received for streets
02:30:22 is about where we were this time last year. Intergovernmental revenues are down
02:30:28 significantly but that is revenue we received from Durham County and so it
02:30:33 mostly has to do with timing. We probably received some payments earlier in the
02:30:37 year, fiscal year last year as opposed to this year. And then charges for services
02:30:42 which are down slightly, about 25%.
02:30:47 So this is a chart, kind of shows you Q1 in fiscal year 24 compared to Q1 in fiscal year
02:30:56 23.
02:30:57 And what you'll notice from this chart is the significant decrease in property tax.
02:31:03 At this time last year we had received over $17 million in property tax and at the end
02:31:10 of Q1 this year we only had about 2 million. So I know that you know we talk
02:31:15 a lot with council about fund balance. This is one of the reasons to have a
02:31:19 very strong healthy fund balance because there can be dips in when your revenue
02:31:25 is collected. So you know we expect to expect to receive our property tax but
02:31:30 we you know we're not receiving it at the same rate that we were in other
02:31:35 fiscal years.
02:31:40 Okay, and this chart just kind of shows you the adopted budget, our activity through the
02:31:49 end of the first quarter, and then where we project the end of the year.
02:31:53 We are projecting that most revenue at this point will be coming in at budget, with hotel
02:32:00 and occupancy tax coming in slightly above budget, and we expect charges for services
02:32:05 to also come in above budget.
02:32:10 Moving over to expenditures, looking at the expenditures, we expect that our expenditures
02:32:18 will be $2.2 million less than budgeted.
02:32:23 The majority of that is in personnel savings, which has to do with some vacancies we have
02:32:28 at the city.
02:32:29 We expect that to be $1.9 million.
02:32:32 And then operating and capital costs, we expect to come under budget by about $304,000.
02:32:40 And no departments are expected to exceed budget at this point.
02:32:45 So this chart gives you a overview of where we are with expenditures from last fiscal year to this fiscal year.
02:32:53 And what you'll notice is that we are, personnel spending is slightly less than it was at this point, last fiscal year.
02:33:02 But operating expenditures are higher than they were at this point last year.
02:33:09 So last year at this time we were about 18 percent of budget when we talked about operating
02:33:14 expenses and this year we're about 26 percent of budget which is about a quarter of the
02:33:22 way through the year.
02:33:25 So this gives you, this is just an overview again of our personnel expenditures and where
02:33:32 we expect to end the year.
02:33:37 And then moving on to enterprise funds.
02:33:42 The first fund I want to talk about is our water sewer fund.
02:33:46 So overall revenues are at 26.2% of budget and expenses are at almost 24% of budget,
02:33:57 with personnel expenses at about 22% of budget and operating expenses at about 23% of budget.
02:34:05 Revenues are currently projected to come in slightly above budget and personnel expenditures
02:34:10 are expected to come in under budget due to some vacancies in that department and then
02:34:16 And operating expenditures are expected to come in at budget.
02:34:21 So this chart gives you an overview of the revenues in the water and sewer fund.
02:34:27 And as I said, those operating revenues were expecting to come in slightly above budget.
02:34:36 And then this is a look at the expenses in the water and sewer fund.
02:34:40 with personnel expenses expected to come in almost $1.3 million under budget.
02:34:47 Which means that the fund would have a positive budget variance of about $1.4 million.
02:34:57 Moving on to the transit fund.
02:34:59 The transit fund is also expected to come in under budget by about $3.8 million.
02:35:05 mostly due to savings in some operating contract expenses,
02:35:10 which is due to some delayed service enhancements
02:35:12 that they have, which is resulting
02:35:14 from some of the driver shortages.
02:35:16 This fund has several funding sources.
02:35:21 It currently has some federal COVID money
02:35:26 that it is still receiving,
02:35:27 and that money will be phasing out in FY24.
02:35:32 And then it also has state funding,
02:35:34 which is expected to be approximately where it was last year at $3.4 million.
02:35:39 And then it does receive a portion of the tax rate.
02:35:45 So looking at the revenues, you can see that grant revenue is expected
02:35:51 to come in slightly over budget, and then the inner governmental revenue is expected to come in under budget.
02:35:58 And that has to do with the revenue is only collected if the service enhancements happen.
02:36:05 So when there's a reduction in service enhancements, then there is a reduction in the revenue that the fund would receive.
02:36:15 And looking at the expense side, you can see that there is a,
02:36:19 the operating expenditures are at about $4.3 million under budget.
02:36:26 with personnel being slightly under budget at about $20,000.
02:36:38 The solid waste fund operating revenues are slightly
02:36:43 less than they were in the first quarter of FY23.
02:36:48 But the fund is expected to receive $12,000 more in operating expenses by the end of the year.
02:36:55 by the end of the fiscal year.
02:36:58 Personnel expenses are expected to come in under budget by about $564,000.
02:37:05 And operating expenses are expected to come in at budget.
02:37:11 The solid waste fund receives, the majority of its funding comes from tax revenue.
02:37:17 And about 30% from operating revenues.
02:37:25 So this shows you an overview of the revenues that I was talking about,
02:37:34 with most of the non-operating revenues coming in at budget and operating revenues coming in slightly above budget.
02:37:46 Looking at expenses for the solid waste fund,
02:37:49 Personnel expenses, as I said, are projected to come in slightly below budget.
02:37:56 And also some of their capital, which would mean that the fund would have a positive
02:38:01 budget variance at the end of the year of almost a million dollars.
02:38:07 The storm water fund, which provides for the maintenance, for
02:38:13 the management and maintenance of the operating expense of storm water activities.
02:38:19 This fund is self-sufficient and receives no tax support.
02:38:23 And at quarter one, it had received 27% of its projected revenues,
02:38:29 which is slightly lower than it was at last time at this year.
02:38:32 But the fund does project to come in at budget.
02:38:39 And just a reminder that this fund is using some of its fund balance this year,
02:38:45 largely for some of the capital improvement projects that they have.
02:38:49 So looking at revenues, this operating revenues in the stormwater fund are
02:38:58 expected to come in at budget. And then expenditures are coming in very close to
02:39:05 budget with operating expenditures at this point coming in slightly over a
02:39:09 budget about $6,000. Moving on to the parking fund, as you are well aware
02:39:19 aware parking fund since COVID has had some issues with operating revenues not covering
02:39:30 operating expenses at this point.
02:39:32 And so they do have a debt service, the debt service fund does provide or does subsidize
02:39:38 some of the existing debt in this fund.
02:39:42 And just a reminder that parking fees were increased in FY23.
02:39:50 And operating expenditures and
02:39:53 personnel expenditures are expected to come in slightly under budget.
02:40:00 So moving on to parking fund revenues.
02:40:03 Operating revenues are expected to come in slightly under budget at about $500,000.
02:40:13 And then expenditures are also expected to come in
02:40:21 slightly under budget at about $200,000.
02:40:27 Which when you look at the revenues and expenditures would be a negative budget variance of about $334,000.
02:40:33 The final fund I want to talk about is the inspection fund.
02:40:41 And these revenues are currently projected to be at budget.
02:40:45 And at the first quarter, the fund had received about 30 percent of budget revenues and spent
02:40:51 about 20 percent of its expenditures.
02:40:54 And the fund is currently projected to end the year with a positive budget variance.
02:40:59 And of course, we have more information as we move forward in our second quarter projections.
02:41:07 So this shows you the revenues for the inspections fund, which we're predicting to come in at
02:41:12 budget.
02:41:15 And then expenditures with personnel expected to come in slightly under budget, which is
02:41:22 due to some budget variances, or sorry, personnel vacancies.
02:41:29 And that is all I have for the first quarter report, and I'm happy to take any questions that people may have.
02:41:36 Thank you so much for your presentation this afternoon.
02:41:39 Are there any questions?
02:41:41 All right.
02:41:45 Thank you, ma'am.
02:41:46 Thank you, Christina.
02:41:47 No questions, just thank you for the work.
02:41:50 You hit the ground running in a position I know that was assumed under challenging and
02:41:56 difficult circumstances, but really been impressed
02:41:59 with your leadership and the way you've taken the helm.
02:42:03 Just one thing, on the general fund revenues,
02:42:05 with that big red line pointing down property taxes,
02:42:08 I know it's because we haven't collected them yet.
02:42:10 I wonder if there's any other way that's more psychologically
02:42:12 amenable that we can present that going forward,
02:42:16 since we know that the money's coming.
02:42:17 You don't have to answer that now, but just, yeah.
02:42:20 Thank you.
02:42:21 It's coming, yeah.
02:42:23 Absolutely.
02:42:24 Thank you so much.
02:42:25 And we will have more information at Q2 will be a much better place to determine how we're doing with property tax.
02:42:31 Maybe put an asterisk next to it or something. I don't know. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor.
02:42:37 Anyone else?
02:42:39 Yes.
02:42:40 I just want to kind of just put an asterisk by
02:42:45 some of the red light items on the capital improvement plan as well and just make sure if
02:42:50 if something's getting out of whack just kind of put it on our radar to
02:42:55 figure out how to address it before it gets,
02:42:58 because what I'm most concerned about is
02:43:01 that the cost doesn't go down.
02:43:04 So if it's paused for cost and you're re-bidding,
02:43:10 the cost is likely to be higher.
02:43:11 So I just want to make sure
02:43:13 that if there's some financing conversations we need to have,
02:43:19 that we have them.
02:43:20 That's mainly the point.
02:43:21 Thank you.
02:43:25 Anyone else?
02:43:28 Thank you so much.
02:43:29 Thank you so much.
02:43:30 I just want to briefly, before we go to our last discussion item, I think all of us probably
02:43:36 got an email from our attorney from some citizens who have been questioning our cell phone usage
02:43:45 up here on the dais.
02:43:47 And I want to say for me for the last two years, a lot of times you will see me on my
02:43:51 cell phone because I'm communicating with a lot of times our clerk and some
02:43:57 of us up here also communicating with staff we're trying to keep things going
02:44:00 so everything is not like we're up here playing with telephones so let me
02:44:05 dispel you of that of that some of us have conversations but at the end of the
02:44:13 day most of the things that I've seen from at least the two people who
02:44:16 normally sit beside me including our city manager is we're actually having
02:44:20 conversations with staff and other people across and out that are out
02:44:24 actually out helping us to make sure that this meeting is going well, that
02:44:29 it's you know the technology is straight, that we're catching people who are
02:44:33 raising their hand on on Zoom. You see me a lot of times look over to our Mayor
02:44:38 Pro Tem. So we're not just up here playing. So I want you to be very sure
02:44:44 that most of us are up here being very diligent and staying focused on
02:44:49 what's happening in the meeting.
02:44:50 So as you see, I was sitting here now, I'm trying to get some information together for
02:44:54 our last topic, which is a discussion on our city council procedures.
02:45:00 Let me preface this by saying that I am by no means trying to personalize or
02:45:05 make issues where there are none.
02:45:09 But in this regard, we have a procedures committee.
02:45:14 I think, well, I know Mayor Pro Tem was the chair of that when I came into this office.
02:45:20 He's maintained his chairmanship of that.
02:45:24 Also, Jillian Johnson, Councilwoman Johnson is a part of that committee.
02:45:30 And also I think when Councilwoman Jose-Hammond came in, I asked her to join that group.
02:45:38 I wanted to tie this up, as you know, this is my last work session.
02:45:42 But I wanted to make sure that we at least know from my vantage point where we have some
02:45:49 gaps in terms of just closing some issues that have come up in regards to behavior of
02:45:54 council person people and that gets real
02:45:57 sticky
02:45:59 but business is business and
02:46:01 I do want to make sure that we are clear that there were some issues that had come up during
02:46:07 my tenure, particularly in this last year, that we have not addressed as a council.
02:46:13 As a result of some of that, I did ask our city attorney to prepare a white paper
02:46:21 concerning some of our procedures around censure,
02:46:27 around fraternization, around a number of issues that will come,
02:46:32 that have come into play since I've been mayor,
02:46:35 and she prepared a 23,
02:46:37 she had a student who prepared a 23-page paper
02:46:40 before we went out on summer break.
02:46:44 I had asked them to do that,
02:46:45 and then when we came back from summer break,
02:46:49 she did pass that paper to us,
02:46:52 and I have had a conversation with Mayor Pro Tem
02:46:54 about us trying to tie up what I see are loose ends
02:46:59 in this arena.
02:47:00 He indicated to me that, you know,
02:47:02 really, his committee had really not meant he's here to speak for himself, but that I
02:47:06 would need to bring it back before the council to see where you all wanted to go with that.
02:47:14 And since this is my last meeting, I felt like I needed to be able to articulate to
02:47:19 you all my concerns about leaving those issues open.
02:47:23 When she did the report, the law student did the report, she looked at a couple of different
02:47:29 cities around us to see what their ethics and code looked like.
02:47:35 And we're not in bad shape, but there are some gaps.
02:47:39 And because of the—basically because of what happened with Councilwoman Hosie Hyman,
02:47:46 I entered into that arena because when it came to the censure that was proposed by Councilwoman
02:47:54 Johnson, there is a requirement under our censure of different things that are
02:48:00 supposed to happen and the conduct that was being alleged to have occurred with
02:48:05 Councilwoman Jose-Hymans purported the censure that was being proposed for that
02:48:12 conduct did not really fit the ordinance governing behavior of council persons in
02:48:21 order to censure. As I read that provision, and it's only one provision, it talks about
02:48:27 and contemplates behavior that happens outside of the council. I'm sorry, behavior that happens
02:48:36 on this dais, and it kind of gives you direction as to what happens on the dais and how you
02:48:41 are to deal with that, lays out a process. But it does not, it did not in my mind speak
02:48:47 to the allegations that were being brought in this proposed censure.
02:48:53 That censure did not pan out, but it was just left kind of open.
02:48:57 And she has since been exonerated from all of those things that were coming up.
02:49:02 There were two instances that were coming up in that proposed censure.
02:49:06 One was the allegation that she had some type of inappropriate
02:49:11 conversation with a city employee.
02:49:14 And that was a part of that in terms of campaign,
02:49:17 asking him to campaign on her behalf.
02:49:20 The DA in her report, the SBI report,
02:49:23 exonerated her from that.
02:49:25 And she was also, as we all know,
02:49:27 exonerated from the statements by the developer.
02:49:30 And it was just kind of, it kind of died
02:49:33 and nothing ever was done with that.
02:49:35 And if you look at the other cities,
02:49:38 there is a process by which you can bring closure
02:49:41 two kinds of those things and not just let it hang out.
02:49:44 On top of that, you had at least three other,
02:49:47 and you all can correct me if I'm wrong,
02:49:49 four other instances where the public
02:49:53 was requesting from this council some type of action
02:49:57 towards other council members for behavior
02:50:01 that fell outside of the dais.
02:50:06 And those were kind of,
02:50:07 We had a request from a citizen to censure or
02:50:14 investigate Councilwoman Caballero purportedly on some
02:50:20 allegations involving her husband and his involvement and
02:50:24 not involvement with SCAD.
02:50:27 And then you had another request from, I think, a citizen about
02:50:36 soon to be mayor, Councilman Williams,
02:50:39 about something in terms of, what was the other one?
02:50:43 I think there was some allegations that he was,
02:50:46 the citizen was requesting a censure on that.
02:50:50 And then there came a letter
02:50:52 from one of his former employees
02:50:54 that had some allegations in it
02:50:56 concerning some things that had happened
02:50:58 in his place of employment.
02:51:00 And all of those things were kind of under,
02:51:03 just kind of left hanging.
02:51:05 And that is not good, in my opinion, for a public body
02:51:10 not to have a way to resolve those issues
02:51:13 and to have a roadmap on how you resolve
02:51:18 those different issues.
02:51:19 What happens if somebody has behavior off the council
02:51:22 and we need to invoke, want to request a censure?
02:51:26 What happens when the general public asks for a censure?
02:51:29 What happens when you have something happening within City
02:51:31 Hall that people are questioning,
02:51:33 which would bring us to fraternization.
02:51:37 You know, we've had some allegations
02:51:38 that a council of persons have been involved
02:51:42 with high-level city management in relationships.
02:51:46 That can cause problems in terms
02:51:50 of the institute of government
02:51:51 if the relationship goes bad
02:51:53 and the employee decides that they want out
02:51:56 and the city is now on notice
02:51:58 that this relationship may actually be occurring
02:52:00 or had occurred.
02:52:01 So it's just stuff like that,
02:52:03 that if you have rules in place to deal with those issues,
02:52:08 it becomes easier to resolve them and move on.
02:52:11 And it doesn't have to, and it's not personal.
02:52:13 It's just business.
02:52:14 Having been a judge for 24 years, you know, 25 years,
02:52:17 I understand that people get caught up in their feelings,
02:52:20 but that does not negate the need to have procedures
02:52:25 in place to handle these situations,
02:52:28 and that makes it easier.
02:52:30 When you have procedures in place
02:52:32 that the council can go to and say,
02:52:33 this is what we're gonna do in this instance.
02:52:36 So I wanted to open that up for discussion
02:52:39 because we've had a couple of instances
02:52:41 even in our evaluations of employees, that matter changed.
02:52:45 Now, is that a standard or is that something you can do
02:52:48 and you can say it last minute,
02:52:49 oh, we're gonna do it differently this year.
02:52:51 Well, that needs to be clarified
02:52:53 because people shouldn't be caught off guard
02:52:55 when you're thinking you're gonna come in
02:52:56 and evaluate people one way
02:52:58 and then you come in and the evaluation has changed
02:53:01 and you have no knowledge of that.
02:53:03 So if you are, like I just told the governor candidate,
02:53:08 you know, when you're in charge of these positions,
02:53:10 you ought to at least have a roadmap on what you're doing
02:53:13 and know what you're doing.
02:53:14 And this area caused a lot of concern for me
02:53:19 in terms of watching how that played out,
02:53:21 particularly with someone who was later exonerated
02:53:24 and nobody from this council has formally offered her
02:53:27 an apology, at least for that.
02:53:29 But we were quick to jump on the bandwagon and say,
02:53:33 let's censure her.
02:53:34 And you didn't even follow your own procedures on doing that.
02:53:37 That's a problem.
02:53:38 That's a real problem.
02:53:39 And that should not happen in 2023.
02:53:43 You should have clarity on how your behavior is
02:53:47 to be governed.
02:53:47 And if somebody is questioning that behavior,
02:53:51 there should be some due process things
02:53:53 that are set in place to safeguard not only the city,
02:53:58 but the individual that's being accused of behaviors.
02:54:02 So that's me as a lawyer.
02:54:04 And that's not a good space to be in.
02:54:07 When I asked Attorney Rayburg to do this,
02:54:12 you know, she said she was gonna have a student to do it,
02:54:15 and I know it was one issue that was tearing people up
02:54:18 on the issue of fraternization.
02:54:20 You gotta deal with those issues.
02:54:21 It's an everyday occurrence.
02:54:22 People find love everywhere.
02:54:24 But you have to be making sure
02:54:25 that you govern that accordingly.
02:54:27 So in her, the student allegedly said at the bottom of the paper,
02:54:32 well, now the city attorney's office has been asked several times about fraternization.
02:54:37 Well, now how would the student know that?
02:54:39 So you can see how it turns into something personal when you bring up these kind of personal issues.
02:54:45 The city is a business.
02:54:47 When somebody sues the city, they're coming for deep pockets and it's not our money.
02:54:54 It's taxpayer money.
02:54:55 And we need to be making sure that we have procedures in place that when something goes
02:55:02 awry between the seven people that sit up here, there's a process that you can turn
02:55:08 to and it's not made up off somebody's head, it's there in black and white and you follow
02:55:13 that process and you don't leave people hanging.
02:55:16 We have left all of those people hanging that I have mentioned that have asked us to take
02:55:22 some type of action against another council person.
02:55:25 We just need to have a process to say,
02:55:27 it's done.
02:55:29 You know, whatever that process is,
02:55:30 it needs to be illuminated.
02:55:32 And you can't just leave this lady to leave
02:55:34 off of this dais after almost having her,
02:55:38 watching her life be destroyed.
02:55:41 And you feel good about having that open?
02:55:44 And never saying anything about that
02:55:46 or bringing it to closure
02:55:48 when you were so quick to punish her?
02:55:51 Where is the right in that?
02:55:54 Where is her due process rights for what happened to her
02:55:58 on this council by members of the status?
02:56:02 And that triggered a response from the community.
02:56:10 So I'm not willing to go off the record on that
02:56:13 and leave this place without that big son said,
02:56:17 that needs to be done, in my opinion.
02:56:20 Anybody else want to talk about it other than me?
02:56:23 Madam Mayor, I'll respond.
02:56:23 Thank you so much for the list of things that you brought to our attention.
02:56:29 I'll start by saying the letter also exonerated the council for
02:56:33 any inappropriate collusion or actions towards Council Member Hyman.
02:56:40 I think that's, we went to rain without the thunder.
02:56:43 I think it's important that we include that that also was in the letter.
02:56:48 Just a couple of just factual statements about the procedures committee.
02:56:53 When we were elected in 2021, I actually assumed the chairmanship at that time.
02:56:58 And at that time, the listed members were you by virtue of being mayor, Councilmember Johnson, and myself.
02:57:04 At a meeting, Councilmember Hyman actually asked about attending the meetings or being a part of it.
02:57:09 And at that time I said that, of course, all members of the council are welcome to attend the meetings, which she was.
02:57:16 That was not placing her on the committee
02:57:19 because that would have made four council members
02:57:21 on the subcommittee, which would have been quorum.
02:57:24 The purpose of the procedures committee
02:57:25 was to have not crossed the threshold of quorum,
02:57:28 but to have three members to talk about recommendations
02:57:31 and then bring them back to the council.
02:57:32 It also should be said, your honor,
02:57:34 that the procedures committee is not a creature of the mayor
02:57:38 or of any one particular council member.
02:57:40 The way the procedures committee is triggered to action
02:57:42 is that the council charges the procedures committee when they think that there's a substantive
02:57:48 question or a threshold has been crossed.
02:57:54 To citizen generated action on the procedures committee, respectfully, citizens are not
02:58:01 members of the council.
02:58:03 So there's never been any requirement on the council because a citizen says, I want to
02:58:08 center a council person.
02:58:10 How do I do that?
02:58:11 I mean, you know, it's kind of like we don't have procedures
02:58:14 for students to initiate tenure.
02:58:17 We don't have procedures for regular citizens
02:58:20 to initiate draw up impeachment articles.
02:58:22 You have to be a member of the body.
02:58:24 And actually, it's really quite easy for a citizen
02:58:27 to initiate a censure of a council member.
02:58:29 All you have to do is get one council member
02:58:31 to agree with you.
02:58:32 And because any council member can put in a resolution
02:58:37 for censure.
02:58:38 The threshold is so you don't really have to even work
02:58:40 that hard if one of us thinks that another council member did something censureable.
02:58:45 For example, something happened a little while ago where many members of the community said
02:58:48 that I probably should initiate some procedures for censure.
02:58:53 And to be quite honest, I think that if I had worked really hard, I think I could have
02:58:57 gotten the votes for a censure or even worse.
02:59:00 But I thought that we were doing a humility and kindness and peace thing, so I thought
02:59:04 in the best interest of the city, you know, we would just move forward.
02:59:08 So I didn't seek that.
02:59:10 So because a citizen wants another member of the council censured,
02:59:15 that's not the threshold for the procedures committee to have a meeting.
02:59:21 I mean, citizens ask us for stuff all the time, ordinances, all kinds of stuff.
02:59:25 So simply asking for it does not obligate the council.
02:59:29 The way the procedures committee is, a majority of the council says,
02:59:32 we want the committee to investigate this.
02:59:36 With respect to the censure of Councilmember Hyman, I think it's important to say that in fact
02:59:43 Councilmember Hyman was not censured. It was contemplated,
02:59:48 which is the prerogative of any council member to contemplate something. And the item that you speak to in the
02:59:55 the Procedures Committee, I think it's 2.14, which contemplates censure, it says if
03:00:01 the action occurred on the dais. It does not, it is not an exhaustive list of
03:00:06 And our procedures committee is not an exhaustive,
03:00:08 comprehensive list.
03:00:09 It's not a shell document.
03:00:11 It's a document that helps us proceed,
03:00:14 but there are a number of examples
03:00:16 that aren't covered by our procedures committee,
03:00:19 procedures manual, that does not preclude it occurring.
03:00:21 For example, thumbs up is not in the procedures committee.
03:00:26 We have a council manager form of government,
03:00:29 and usually in those form of government,
03:00:31 the mayor doesn't get to unilaterally issue keys
03:00:33 to the city.
03:00:34 council vote because it's not a strong mayor system. We don't buck against that.
03:00:38 We haven't, you know, come against that. So there are any number of areas that
03:00:43 have been established as council norms and practices that aren't explicitly
03:00:47 spoken to in the procedures manual, but does not preclude us from doing those
03:00:52 things. So 2.14, and folk can read it, you can go on the website now and pull it up,
03:00:56 does not preclude the council from contemplating actions outside of the
03:01:03 of the dais. What it says that if it occurs at the dais,
03:01:07 here's the process for that. But it is well within the purview
03:01:11 of the council to contemplate a censure for, I think it says,
03:01:17 extreme or egregious, whatever the language is, activity,
03:01:21 wherever it occurs. But if it occurs on the dais, and again,
03:01:25 you can read the language, then here's the process. So there
03:01:27 There's no violation of the procedures rules at all.
03:01:33 We issue resolutions all the time as a council member.
03:01:36 Any council member, again, any council member who thinks that one of us did something censurable, you're free to come up with the resolution and enter it.
03:01:44 I will also say as to what happened to the censure, and I think I mentioned this to you in private, your honor.
03:01:51 Council Member Hyman, what happened to your censure is, we had a private meeting one night.
03:01:55 There wasn't four of us there with a prominent member of the community, and I looked across
03:02:00 the table and said, no, it's not, she's not going to be censured.
03:02:03 I'm not going to vote to censure her.
03:02:05 Others were there because it was, one, it wasn't in the best interest of the city, and
03:02:10 the votes weren't there.
03:02:11 That's what happened to the censure.
03:02:13 Now we know that, and for the, it's the council's prerogative not to follow through on a censure.
03:02:20 So on the evening when after the work session, when it was on the agenda or when it was supposed
03:02:27 to be on the agenda and it didn't show up, the reason why it didn't show up is because
03:02:32 we looked across the table at a meeting where some prominent members were there.
03:02:38 Her Honor was there, I was there, and I looked across the table and said it's not going to
03:02:41 happen.
03:02:42 That's what happened.
03:02:43 And so it did not come up.
03:02:45 And that is well within the purview of the council to the council give us resolutions,
03:02:51 they take them away.
03:02:53 So again, that's not a violation of our procedures.
03:02:57 And finally, because citizens want us to do something, and you know, you say it's not
03:03:03 personal, but for some of us it feels very personal.
03:03:06 It seems like there are a group of citizens that have captured the imagination and attention
03:03:11 of members of this council to the point
03:03:13 where they actually say the same things
03:03:15 from the dais and the audience that seem to think
03:03:18 that because they have a neat idea
03:03:20 of how government should work,
03:03:22 that the whole apparatus of government
03:03:23 should somehow bend towards their will.
03:03:25 That is not the way it works.
03:03:28 If you want a council member censure,
03:03:30 just enter the resolution and get the votes.
03:03:33 So that's the process.
03:03:35 If I want a president impeached,
03:03:38 I write to my congressperson and ask them
03:03:41 to do the articles of impeachment.
03:03:42 I can't submit articles of impeachment.
03:03:45 They're the council procedures.
03:03:48 So, you know, and I think we all have our supporters,
03:03:51 we all have the people we listen to,
03:03:52 we all have our friends, we all have our chairing sections,
03:03:55 we all have our echo chambers.
03:03:56 But because they think that that's the way
03:03:59 government should work, doesn't mean that that's so.
03:04:02 So, and I can remember when the,
03:04:05 when Council Member Reese chaired the Procedures Committee,
03:04:07 I remember a grand total of one procedures committee, one.
03:04:12 At that, I remember we discussed the term residents versus citizens.
03:04:16 There was a council travel policy item on the agenda, and there was supposed to be a follow up.
03:04:22 I think meeting for that, it didn't occur.
03:04:24 Council member Reese went on to move for personal matters.
03:04:31 When we got, so the procedures committee was kind of in limbo.
03:04:35 But so when we came in, I assumed the chairmanship.
03:04:38 And Madam Mayor, as to the matter of fraternization,
03:04:44 the attorney numerous times have spoken
03:04:47 to the absence of a policy.
03:04:50 Now, if the committee, if the council wants
03:04:52 to adopt the policy moving forward,
03:04:55 that's on the council, but because it's non-existent
03:04:59 or because we did not hear the answer we wanted to hear
03:05:03 to a question or doesn't comport with our views or whatever,
03:05:06 doesn't mean that the procedure,
03:05:08 council procedures are deficient.
03:05:10 I know with many council members here
03:05:12 that the argument about waiting for a new council
03:05:16 to look at SCAD resonates with you,
03:05:18 or punting down SCAD.
03:05:20 If you think it's a good idea for us to have waited on SCAD,
03:05:23 then how much more so does it make more sense
03:05:26 for this council to wait for the next council
03:05:29 to deal with a matter that is fully about the council,
03:05:33 whereas SCAD is something that falls
03:05:37 into the realm of governance.
03:05:38 This is just purely council stuff,
03:05:40 and we're a lame duck council by our own admission,
03:05:42 so if the next council wants to look at all of that list,
03:05:47 that's fine, but there was no violation of procedures.
03:05:51 And finally, the suggestion that we apologize
03:05:55 to Council Member Hyman, again, suggests that
03:05:59 It tries to raise the specter and implicate
03:06:01 that there was collusion, for which we were also exonerated
03:06:05 by the same letter that exonerated her.
03:06:09 I'm going to apologize because Councilmember Johnson wrote up
03:06:12 a resolution for censure.
03:06:13 That never happened.
03:06:16 That's her right to do that.
03:06:19 Am I going to apologize because I
03:06:20 was at a meeting with prominent people
03:06:24 that you were at, Your Honor, and made the censure go away
03:06:27 in the interest of healing the city and moving forward,
03:06:30 what is there for me to apologize about?
03:06:33 I didn't make the charges.
03:06:34 We're more mad at each other
03:06:36 than the person that actually brought the charges.
03:06:40 We've been tearing each other apart
03:06:42 and not doing a whole lot of talk.
03:06:45 I sat at this dais and said,
03:06:48 when that letter came out as part of my announcements,
03:06:51 how pleased I was for her and her family,
03:06:53 and I said I was ready to bring the wrath of God
03:06:55 down on the guy who made it.
03:06:58 That's what I said publicly.
03:06:59 So should I have added I'm sorry?
03:07:02 I did say I'm sorry that she went through that.
03:07:04 I've said that to Council Member Hyman privately.
03:07:07 She has the text messages, and I've said it publicly.
03:07:10 But I apologize because somebody wrote a resolution.
03:07:15 Apologize because somebody made up a story about us
03:07:21 and repeated the story and repeated the story
03:07:23 and repeated the story.
03:07:24 and 12 people with 35 followers on Facebook
03:07:27 kept repeating the story?
03:07:30 It doesn't make it true.
03:07:33 So what do we apologize?
03:07:34 I am grateful to God that she was exonerated,
03:07:36 but I didn't do anything.
03:07:37 We didn't do that.
03:07:40 And the same letter that exonerated her exonerated us.
03:07:43 That's all I have to say about the procedural aspects.
03:07:45 There was no violation of procedures.
03:07:46 2.14 says if it happened at the dais,
03:07:50 but it also allows for the contemplation of behavior
03:07:53 outside of the dais.
03:07:54 I wish there's no procedure outline
03:07:57 on how you deal with that, which is my point.
03:08:00 So we, we, we, I differ on a lot of things that you have said,
03:08:06 but I respect your opinion.
03:08:07 But that is not my opinion.
03:08:08 The first one is that I'm an independent thinker.
03:08:12 I've always been there.
03:08:13 So if my words resonate with other people,
03:08:16 that's because we might think alike in certain instances.
03:08:19 That's true with everybody up here.
03:08:21 There have been some times that I've agreed with just about
03:08:23 everybody up here on different things.
03:08:25 So, I am a very independent thinker, have always been.
03:08:29 So, I don't pick up on messages and then make them my own
03:08:34 because that's the echo chamber I want to create for myself.
03:08:39 I ain't ever had to do that, not gonna start it at 61.
03:08:43 So, I take issue with that.
03:08:45 I also take issue with the statement where you're saying
03:08:47 everybody's mad at each other.
03:08:49 I'm not mad at you all.
03:08:50 You do what you do, it's not personal.
03:08:53 It feels personal to her, what happened to her,
03:08:57 but for what has happened to me, I volunteered for this job.
03:09:01 I did not understand all that it would entail.
03:09:04 And I don't particularly like some people,
03:09:06 but that's not gonna keep me from doing my job, right?
03:09:10 So it doesn't become personal for me in that range.
03:09:14 And I've had the experience of having to deal with that
03:09:17 in most of my jobs,
03:09:18 where personality just doesn't,
03:09:21 couldn't enter into that space.
03:09:22 So I'm very concrete about my ability
03:09:26 to be an independent thinker.
03:09:28 The second thing is that I take an issue with
03:09:30 is the sentence that you write on
03:09:33 that you were exonerated.
03:09:37 Having been a part of that process,
03:09:40 I have questions in my mind
03:09:42 how that sentence ended up in there, right?
03:09:44 Because I know for sure, like you said,
03:09:46 There have been some private conversation.
03:09:48 But when this hit the news,
03:09:52 when Kim Rayburg sent out that memo
03:09:56 on Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock
03:09:57 as I was traveling back from a funeral,
03:10:00 and I got it, and I talked to her,
03:10:02 and I asked her,
03:10:03 what is this about, and who are you talking about?
03:10:06 And she said, I'm not gonna tell you that.
03:10:08 At the same time, you called me.
03:10:11 And during that time, you told me who it was.
03:10:13 by initials, you told me who it was,
03:10:16 and also you had a process by which
03:10:21 we were going to try to deal with that.
03:10:22 And I told you I wasn't gonna do that.
03:10:23 And I won't get into all those details, right?
03:10:26 So it wasn't, I'm not gonna get into all those details,
03:10:29 I'll have a back and forth.
03:10:30 I'm just telling you, from my vantage point,
03:10:33 and from looking at the other ordinances by city,
03:10:38 there are some processes that I believe
03:10:41 that I hope the next council will fill in
03:10:43 so you don't have these issues.
03:10:46 If a citizen is who each and every citizen
03:10:51 should have a way to get to this council
03:10:54 about any kind of issue, and they do.
03:10:57 But if it's something where it requires
03:10:59 a move to the council, as you're saying,
03:11:01 in the terms of getting a censure,
03:11:03 where is that in your process?
03:11:05 Where does it say that a private citizen
03:11:08 who is seeking some relief, a censure,
03:11:13 or some type of action by the total counsel
03:11:16 on an ethical violation.
03:11:18 Those are not... these are not new things.
03:11:19 They happen all over the country.
03:11:21 It's nothing new.
03:11:22 But where's your process for that?
03:11:24 Where's your process that said...
03:11:25 because they shouldn't have to guess.
03:11:27 This is a governing body,
03:11:29 and a governing body should have rules that indicate...
03:11:32 it's just like, as a judge, we have a judicial code of ethics,
03:11:37 and we have a whole commission that governs that behavior.
03:11:40 Same thing for lawyers.
03:11:43 And it gets revised and updated,
03:11:45 and you keep on as times change,
03:11:48 needs change in that arena.
03:11:50 And I don't understand that pushback.
03:11:53 Unless you don't like rules.
03:11:56 And ways to let people know how, if you violate a rule,
03:12:00 you have these due process rights.
03:12:03 If you're on the other end of that,
03:12:05 you should have a process for being able to get that issue
03:12:08 before your governing body. This is taxpayer money that we deal with. It's
03:12:14 not our money and we can't run it like we run our house like you tell us. And
03:12:17 most households have rules and you know what those rules are. In a governing body
03:12:24 it should be the same. It's not personal. It's a business and we're dealing with
03:12:29 other people's money. Councilwoman Freeman. Thank you Madam Mayor. I
03:12:36 I appreciate that you're highlighting the gaps,
03:12:41 so to speak, and I do appreciate,
03:12:44 and trying to keep it in very business context,
03:12:48 what I will say is that I think,
03:12:51 in addition to fraternization and conduct on council
03:12:59 or off council, there's a gap in workplace harassment
03:13:04 on this dais just acknowledging that Councilmember Hyman was being bullied.
03:13:09 And that still has not been addressed. And for the person who was bullying her to say that they
03:13:14 don't owe her an apology is very unsettling. And I can feel myself getting angry just hearing it
03:13:22 again. I know that there should also be a policy in addressing disclosures. Those things need to
03:13:31 to be updated and I hear Mayor Pro Tem and saying that you know you took the
03:13:36 gavel in 2021 and you may not have been prepared but after March 2023 I don't
03:13:43 see how you couldn't have thought that there should be a meeting to come up
03:13:47 with something because those areas are gaps and we do need to address them and
03:13:53 whether it's this council the next council or whomever I'm gonna hope that
03:13:58 that there's some relief for future councils,
03:14:04 because these are things that other councils across the country have in place and we do not.
03:14:10 And that is what is highlighted in the city attorney's report, essentially.
03:14:16 And so just taking those few items and making sure that they move forward is enough.
03:14:21 We don't have to keep going back and forth.
03:14:23 I do think that to just be very clear,
03:14:29 trying to rewrite history
03:14:31 and trying to make yourself look favorable to the public
03:14:34 is not acceptable in this space.
03:14:37 It's just not.
03:14:38 You really committed, you committed a crime
03:14:41 and you need to be really upfront about it.
03:14:44 And I'm really just so sick of you trying to pretend
03:14:47 like you didn't do it.
03:14:49 That's first.
03:14:50 And then second, to the point that none of you
03:14:54 have apologized to Council Member Hyndman,
03:14:55 it is disgusting, again, which is why I said it that night,
03:14:59 and I'll say it again today, it is still disgusting
03:15:02 because you ruined her life.
03:15:05 You tried to take her out, and she stood in the face of it.
03:15:11 And the fact that there were elders in the community
03:15:14 who had to call you to task on it is just so upset.
03:15:17 Like, really, that's what took you,
03:15:19 That's what made you step back from a resolution
03:15:21 instead of calling her?
03:15:23 I just, I'm troubled by this conversation.
03:15:26 I'm very triggered because I have faced domestic violence.
03:15:30 I have faced just personal violence
03:15:33 and I refuse to deal with that here,
03:15:35 which is why I brought it up before
03:15:37 to say that we've got to get someone to come in here
03:15:39 because it is not okay to be bullying your colleagues.
03:15:43 It's just not.
03:15:44 And you have to stop.
03:15:46 It's unacceptable.
03:15:48 And if you can't hear that, I've said it to you as a sister,
03:15:51 I've said it to you as an enemy.
03:15:52 I've said it to you a number of times and I am tired of saying it.
03:15:56 You have to stop.
03:15:59 It's not okay.
03:16:00 Gentleman Freeman, the people of the city have seen.
03:16:02 I think it would be appropriate to have the conversations
03:16:08 with a facilitator because it is not gonna work today.
03:16:12 I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm gonna get upset and it's gonna get violent.
03:16:15 Are you gonna hit me again?
03:16:16 I never hit you.
03:16:17 I never hit you in the first place.
03:16:19 And the fact that you lie like that,
03:16:21 and you lie with a straight face as a pastor,
03:16:24 is disgusting.
03:16:25 It continues to be disgusting.
03:16:27 I don't know how you even caught,
03:16:28 like what are you doing?
03:16:29 A man in the community.
03:16:31 A man, a black man.
03:16:33 Wait a minute, can I please?
03:16:35 Caballero, have the floor.
03:16:37 We're gonna do this peacefully.
03:16:39 Not gonna turn into that.
03:16:41 We're gonna do this peacefully.
03:16:43 Councilwoman Caballero, Councilwoman Hosea-Hammond,
03:16:49 and then we'll come back to you, Mayor Pro Tem.
03:16:51 And we're gonna do it peacefully.
03:16:52 This is an adult situation.
03:16:55 We're gonna act like that,
03:16:56 and we're not gonna get into that backroom.
03:16:58 You just can disagree, agree to disagree.
03:17:01 We're not gonna be disagreeable.
03:17:02 I get you.
03:17:04 She's not departing without hearing.
03:17:06 This woman, she just accused me of a crime on the dais.
03:17:09 Hold up, hold up.
03:17:11 Stop committing crimes.
03:17:12 Dijon, hold up.
03:17:15 Councilwoman Javier.
03:17:17 Thank you, Madam Mayor.
03:17:18 I appreciate your comments
03:17:21 about how the procedures need to be updated.
03:17:25 I appreciate what the city attorney's office
03:17:27 provided us in the summertime.
03:17:29 As a council member who will be here next round,
03:17:33 I look forward to being a positive member of the board
03:17:38 and adding what we need to add.
03:17:41 Honestly, Council Member Freeman is leaving,
03:17:44 the hour is late.
03:17:46 I don't really know how this conversation
03:17:48 will be productive, thank you.
03:17:50 And I agree, I'll let Councilwoman Jose-Hammond
03:17:53 has the last say, and that's all I'm trying to say.
03:17:55 Thank you, Councilwoman, and then you'll get your part.
03:17:59 I thank you for that.
03:18:00 It's just that at certain times you need to just update it
03:18:03 to conform with what's going on.
03:18:05 We had a lot to happen last year.
03:18:07 And so, you know, we were all kind of wrestling
03:18:11 with how to deal with all of it.
03:18:13 And I don't want those things that have been come to us
03:18:17 that point to you and you're not given an opportunity
03:18:21 to address that.
03:18:22 That's not fair.
03:18:23 That has to be a procedure to deal with
03:18:26 your due process rights and what these citizens are saying.
03:18:32 There needs to be a process for that.
03:18:34 That's clear and it can close it.
03:18:37 Councilwoman Hosenheimer.
03:18:39 So, you know, what I'd like to say is it's still very troubling
03:18:44 to me, and every time we have this conversation,
03:18:47 my husband had to leave because he just does not want
03:18:50 to be here because I've had to calm him down several times,
03:18:55 especially watching his wife go through what I went through
03:18:59 and especially, as he said, having to deal with not just,
03:19:03 you know, black men sending up the paper, but just men
03:19:05 in general that he also had respected.
03:19:08 But for me, I'm just very still troubled because it has affected my life.
03:19:13 While I'm not going to be on this council, I still have to go on with my life and I still
03:19:19 have to deal with that, right?
03:19:21 And so the statement that was made in the report from the DA, which says additionally
03:19:28 there was no evidence that there was coordinated evidence led by the council members to initiate
03:19:33 allegations against Hoseley Hyman. You did not initiate the allegations. It was
03:19:39 a builder by the name of Jared Eden that actually said it to a city staff member,
03:19:47 then went to the attorney, then went to Mayor Pro Tem, then went to the mayor as
03:19:55 the last person, and then I was, well not the last person, because I was the last
03:19:59 person and to this day actually really no one asked me about whether I had did
03:20:05 it or not except for Mr. Williams who texted me the day he was at a forum and
03:20:09 I said no that was not something that I did. So it's still disheartening to me
03:20:15 that you just as from common humility for what I have been through, for what I
03:20:23 told you I've been through, for what my family been through, that you would not
03:20:27 say, you know what sister, we apologize for you going through that process, right?
03:20:33 And it's disheartening because when I put my name in the hat to be on council, I
03:20:38 really, really wanted to come and help the people of Durham. I really did and I
03:20:43 really had a great respect for all of you up here. But I'm hoping and praying
03:20:48 that you do look at the policy and procedures because in the procedure that
03:20:54 I read, it does say that somebody being sanctioned is based on your behavior up here on the dais.
03:21:02 That's what the policy says.
03:21:03 So there was no policy in my sense, in what I went through, that was followed, because
03:21:09 I was interviewed by the FBI, the SBI, on about allegations that was a he say, she say.
03:21:17 And none of my colleagues chose to say, okay, let's have a conversation with you, but what
03:21:22 What we're going to do is we're going to send it to the SBI.
03:21:25 And when you send something to the SBI and the FBI also gets involved, that's something
03:21:30 I've never been through in my entire life.
03:21:32 I never thought at 58 years that I would even have to go through something like that because
03:21:38 my life, while I have not been perfect, I have prided myself on ethics and integrity.
03:21:45 There are certain situations that I didn't get to because I was told, you can't get to
03:21:50 this high level because you have too much integrity. And then to come here and
03:21:55 that to be questioned and then for me to try to stand because it was also told to
03:22:01 me that people on this committee, I mean excuse me, this council wanted me to
03:22:05 resign and if I resigned the allegations wouldn't went away and I contemplated
03:22:10 that. I really did but I said you know what I know I didn't do anything and I'm
03:22:15 gonna try to stand and every time I came in here was hard it is a bit hard for me
03:22:19 now. It was even hard for me to try to run a campaign. I couldn't raise any
03:22:24 money. I couldn't keep a team because of these allegations. I had team members
03:22:29 that were with me that left my team and went to Leonardo Williams team, right?
03:22:33 Whatever people do, they do. But I want you to understand, and I know you don't
03:22:37 care, because I could, again, it's like a retraumatization of me looking at the
03:22:43 meeting on 3-23, which I could not look at. And if you look at the meeting on
03:22:48 323. It is obvious that it was to me. Set in motion to get me to lead this
03:22:55 council. Look at the meeting again. I could not look at it, but I've looked at
03:22:59 it and it was obvious. And there was a meeting that you said that you had with
03:23:05 the community and prominent community members that asked you not to do this
03:23:11 sanction. But why wasn't that discussed among us? Why wasn't I invited to that
03:23:16 Why didn't somebody say to me, Dr. Hyman, did you do A, B, C,
03:23:18 and D again?
03:23:20 And so it's just really disheartening.
03:23:21 Like, I am so disheartened about my experience here,
03:23:26 but I will tell you what I'm not disheartened about.
03:23:28 I'm not disheartened about the fact that I tried to fight for
03:23:30 the people of Durham.
03:23:32 I'm not disheartened by the fact that people have emailed me
03:23:35 continuously throughout this month and said,
03:23:37 Dr. Hyman, you've handled this with grace,
03:23:41 with leadership, and integrity.
03:23:43 And I didn't think at times I was doing that.
03:23:45 This has been very hard for me, and it's still very disturbing to me for us to get to a point
03:23:51 that you have to have these arguments and you can't have a conversation.
03:23:55 And the last time the argument blew up with this, it all going on media,
03:23:59 which affected Ms. Dijon and Mayor Pro Tem's situation on whether somebody hit somebody,
03:24:05 whether somebody did.
03:24:06 To me, I've never thought that I would be in a position like this of the level of power
03:24:13 that you say, Mayor Pro Tem, that this body has,
03:24:16 we left the last stop, in the level of unprofessionalism
03:24:20 and disregard for common courtesy for one another.
03:24:24 I thank God that I was able to serve with the mayor,
03:24:28 Mayor Elaine O'Neill, because I don't think
03:24:31 I could have got through this without her.
03:24:34 I don't think I could have got through this
03:24:36 without Dijon Afrima, which people, you know,
03:24:38 have your opinions on.
03:24:41 But people on this council wanted me to resign and said,
03:24:44 if you resign, it'll go away.
03:24:46 In the statement that the lawyer made,
03:24:49 Attorney Rayburn, and I couldn't even look at it,
03:24:52 but I have had to look at it because I've had to turn things
03:24:55 over to the FBI and SBI, when she made the statement
03:24:58 that basically I was guilty, the statement in her memo said
03:25:03 that no, that it didn't seem in her preview of dealing
03:25:08 preview of dealing with a builder who has come before the council that he would come
03:25:13 up with any force or malice intentions of an allegation.
03:25:18 And you know what, Mayor Pro Tem, I respect the fact that you said, let's hold this
03:25:22 man accountable.
03:25:24 But not nobody else on this council have said, and you haven't hold him accountable, because
03:25:28 guess what?
03:25:30 His projects are going to come before here.
03:25:33 They've been coming before.
03:25:34 He's now changed his name.
03:25:36 not the one bringing them in front of you, but some other people are bringing his projects
03:25:39 in front of you.
03:25:40 And I don't want anybody to be able to come up and say, you know what, council may elect
03:25:47 Leonardo Williams an allegation against you, or you know what, Cabrera, an allegation about
03:25:54 any of you, any of you.
03:25:56 So I still have that heart to make sure, and you can sigh, Cabrera, because at one point
03:26:01 we was on the trail, you were real nice, and now you go back to your nastiness, but it's
03:26:05 okay, that's just who you are because now you're elected.
03:26:07 But what I'm saying is I don't want anybody else,
03:26:11 you could care less about me,
03:26:12 but I don't want anybody else to go through
03:26:15 what my family went through, what I went through,
03:26:17 and what I have to continue to go through
03:26:19 in trying to start my life again.
03:26:22 I'm a professor at North Carolina Central.
03:26:23 I could not go up for, I was going up for early tenure.
03:26:26 I didn't even choose to do that because this was out.
03:26:28 I don't know what's gonna happen
03:26:29 when we try to go up for next,
03:26:31 coming up in my regular time.
03:26:33 whatever opportunities that I would like to have done.
03:26:35 Things were taken from me because of this.
03:26:38 And you have the sense to say, we don't want to apologize?
03:26:41 No, you didn't start it.
03:26:43 But you, all of you, voted on it,
03:26:46 and you pushed it to go to the SBI.
03:26:49 And I'm going to say another thing with this statement
03:26:51 in this report.
03:26:52 You keep saying that you were exonerated.
03:26:54 Well, I don't understand that, because not one of you
03:26:57 were interviewed.
03:26:57 But I know who was interviewed.
03:26:59 And I know the questions that were asked.
03:27:01 And not one of you were asked whether or not you had a part in this process of these allegations.
03:27:07 So this statement to me, which I've already said to the DA, is a little troubling to me.
03:27:12 But she's the DA.
03:27:16 You know, I'm just going to continue to try to do what I do, which is pray for all of
03:27:22 you, because after these—during these nine months, I still try to pray for you.
03:27:27 And I think you feel that you've arrived because now you're in these positions.
03:27:31 But I've also always have always said to Mayor-elect Williams that I felt he had a heart and he
03:27:36 had some humility.
03:27:37 And I hope that he continues to try to have that.
03:27:42 I hope.
03:27:43 And serve the city and work with the people of Durham.
03:27:46 And I just don't want anybody to ever go through anything that I went through.
03:27:49 And it's just disheartening that even in my last day that you will still have this argument
03:27:54 and you still would be making faces and you still would be, I gotta go with what my life
03:27:59 was.
03:28:00 I just, I don't, I had so much respect for all of you.
03:28:02 I just don't understand that.
03:28:05 I always questioned why God allowed me to go through this.
03:28:08 That's my question to me now.
03:28:09 What was the purpose?
03:28:11 What was my lesson in this?
03:28:12 Because I didn't come in to have this go, I came in to help.
03:28:17 And so I'm pondering, I'm going through this now.
03:28:21 I tried to run a campaign with integrity, and I could not do that because of these allegations.
03:28:26 Well, I had the integrity, but I couldn't get the support that I needed.
03:28:29 I want to thank all of the residents in Durham
03:28:32 that gave me those 12,000 votes.
03:28:34 I want to thank you.
03:28:35 And I want to thank you for the ones who continue
03:28:37 to send me emails, even as of yesterday,
03:28:40 about how I've handled myself.
03:28:42 But I'm disheartened still
03:28:45 that we are at the point now,
03:28:46 with everything that I've been through,
03:28:48 that we are arguing among each other
03:28:50 and we're making faces,
03:28:51 the same faces and the arguments in the,
03:28:54 I just hope the new council that comes on,
03:28:56 I hope y'all do different,
03:28:57 because Durham deserves better.
03:28:59 They do.
03:29:01 I don't even know what else to say.
03:29:07 All right.
03:29:08 Council Member Hyman, thank you so much.
03:29:10 And as I've said, I apologize for what you're going through, and I'll do it again publicly.
03:29:17 I also want to thank you for what you didn't say here today.
03:29:22 Council Member Freeman, in an open setting on this dais, said that I was bullying you.
03:29:29 And I want to invite you, Council Member Hyman, to release every message, every email, every text I've ever sent you.
03:29:37 At no point since you arrived on this council have I ever had one conversation with you about the way you voted or the way you were going to vote.
03:29:47 I have never come to you and asked you to vote a certain way.
03:29:51 I have never questioned you after you voted.
03:29:53 I've never sought to influence your vote in any way whatsoever.
03:29:58 We don't hang out outside of meetings.
03:30:01 We don't break bread.
03:30:02 We haven't, you know, had any social time.
03:30:05 So I invite Councilmember Freeman or anyone else
03:30:10 who has once again put out this canard about me bullying folk
03:30:15 that the people of this city have rejected squarely
03:30:17 in this last election,
03:30:20 release any text message that was bullying,
03:30:22 recount any conversation I've ever had with you
03:30:26 where I said something untoward
03:30:28 because of the way you voted.
03:30:29 Tell me one time, other people have tried to get you
03:30:32 to vote a certain way.
03:30:33 Tell me one time where I've ever had any conversation
03:30:36 with you or tried to influence you
03:30:38 since you've been on the council.
03:30:40 And I invite that to be out there.
03:30:42 It is a lie.
03:30:44 It was a lie when it was not from you.
03:30:46 What Council Member Freeman said,
03:30:47 it was a lie when it was first told.
03:30:49 The people of Durham saw through it and rejected it.
03:30:52 I also wanna say to you, sister,
03:30:53 that I've never come to you and said that you should resign.
03:30:57 You said people have said that if you resign, it'll go away.
03:30:59 I don't know who those council members are,
03:31:01 but I wasn't one of them.
03:31:02 What I did have as the number two in this city,
03:31:05 and the number one and number two of any organization
03:31:07 ought to be able to have confidential conversations.
03:31:10 I went to Her Honor in confidence.
03:31:12 Her Honor will remember the conversation, called her,
03:31:15 and I said, Your Honor,
03:31:16 if these allegations are true, then she should resign.
03:31:22 As you should, Mayor, and as I should.
03:31:24 If we tried to sell our vote, we should resign.
03:31:27 Here's what else I said.
03:31:29 If it's not true, I'm ready to...
03:31:33 I want her to come out and say that that man is lying,
03:31:36 and I am ready to go to bat for her and bring war to him.
03:31:40 But we need that statement.
03:31:41 That's the statement.
03:31:42 That was a statement in confidence.
03:31:44 You never heard me say that to you.
03:31:45 I never came to you and said,
03:31:47 you should resign.
03:31:48 That was a privileged conversation
03:31:51 between the number one and two of a city,
03:31:54 which leaders do all over the world all the time,
03:31:56 should have that space to have those kind of conversations.
03:32:00 I called for ShotSpotter, that made the news.
03:32:03 I called for guaranteed income, that made the news.
03:32:06 When I call for something, it's out in the media.
03:32:10 No one ever called for your, at least I didn't,
03:32:13 I never called for your resignation
03:32:15 because if I had called for it,
03:32:16 it would have been a matter of public record.
03:32:18 What I did have as the number two of this city
03:32:22 was a confidential conversation
03:32:24 with the principal of the city
03:32:25 to discuss and war game a scenario.
03:32:28 That's the only time the word,
03:32:30 "'Resign' ever came out my mouth.
03:32:33 Never had a conversation with you about your votes?"
03:32:35 So this line that keeps being pushed,
03:32:38 again, which has been squarely rejected
03:32:40 by the people of this city, again, is still being pushed.
03:32:43 And I would just say this in conclusion.
03:32:46 I think we have to be very careful, sister,
03:32:48 to, if there's a hole or weakness in the DA's letter on one side, then somebody might come
03:32:59 and say, well, maybe the investigation wasn't that good on the other side as either.
03:33:05 Maybe it wasn't an exoneration, maybe there just wasn't enough evidence.
03:33:10 Maybe she's not innocent, maybe there just wasn't enough evidence to prove it.
03:33:14 I think that if we're going to celebrate the letter, which I did, it kind of compromises
03:33:19 the integrity of the letter by saying she did a good job on this part that's good for
03:33:23 me, but she didn't do a good job on this part that's good for the other folk.
03:33:28 And I just want to...
03:33:29 I'm sorry.
03:33:30 Yeah, I'm finishing.
03:33:31 So again, I've released the text.
03:33:35 I give you permission to release every conversation, every text, every phone call, every email
03:33:41 I've ever sent to you to put it out there and show where I've bullied you or show where
03:33:47 I've shown anything other than concern in an attempt to get through this really ugly
03:33:52 process.
03:33:53 I have apologized for what you've gone through, but I can't pretend that I was part of something
03:34:01 cooking this up because I wasn't.
03:34:04 And that's just the fact.
03:34:06 And I know we want to leave, but what I want to say is, again, I am not digging deep, as
03:34:13 you say, Mayor Pro Tem, holes in the DA statement.
03:34:16 I am not doing that.
03:34:17 What I'm saying is what I went through.
03:34:19 I know who was interviewed.
03:34:20 I know the premise of the interviews.
03:34:22 And the interviews were not based on whether you colluded as a council to do this against
03:34:30 me.
03:34:31 That was not the interviews.
03:34:32 And I know the people who were interviewed, right?
03:34:35 And I know the premise of, so I'm not digging a hole in her report.
03:34:39 What I'm saying is that no, maybe you did not come up with the allegations, but there
03:34:45 was a builder that came up with the allegations that brought it to the council, and the council
03:34:49 decided to move forward with it prior to even asking me about whether I did it or not.
03:34:55 And I wish I would have known that you said I need, because I kept saying I didn't do
03:34:58 it.
03:34:59 And nobody moved on it.
03:35:01 What they moved on was, we're going to send this to the SBI.
03:35:05 So there was a time when I said I did not do this, and I clearly said it to my may elect
03:35:10 Leonardo Williams, who clearly text me and said, Dr. Hyman, is this you?
03:35:15 And I said, no, I did not do this.
03:35:17 And he said, okay, let's stop texting.
03:35:19 He did ask me that.
03:35:20 So there was conversations with him.
03:35:22 And the mayor knew that I said I didn't do it.
03:35:24 So we can go back and forth.
03:35:28 I'm not bringing up the bullying situation, because that's not something I said today.
03:35:32 What I did say in my statement at this dais was that you did, while nobody else came except
03:35:38 for D. Jerome Freeman and the mayor, when I did have my press conference, you did text
03:35:42 me before I even knew that the report was out.
03:35:45 I was at Central.
03:35:46 You texted me.
03:35:47 You said, you know, I'm glad that this came out.
03:35:50 I'm praying for you.
03:35:51 And you have been doing that ever since.
03:35:54 So I didn't bring that up today.
03:35:55 What I'm bringing up is the issue of how I went through and how I was treated.
03:36:00 And I know people don't, I know the city is tired of it.
03:36:03 I just want y'all to go on and I just want you to serve the people of Durham.
03:36:07 And I just don't want people to ever have to go through this again.
03:36:10 And if you have any kind of spiritual sense in your being, understand what I went through.
03:36:16 Understand what I still have to go through and why my husband had to walk out this door.
03:36:22 Understand that.
03:36:23 All right, we will now turn to our clerk for any boards and commissions.
03:36:31 Good afternoon, Council. Item 1, Participatory Budgeting Steering Committee Appointment.
03:36:42 I have a tie from Council when it comes to re-advertisement and nominating the candidate
03:36:49 a hand for Hannah Bartlebow.
03:36:54 So I'm not sure if anyone.
03:36:56 You can change them on the re-advertise.
03:36:58 Thank you very much.
03:36:59 Thank you.
03:37:00 That's the end of my report.
03:37:02 All right, we will now move to settle our agenda
03:37:04 with our manager.
03:37:06 Settle y'all agenda.
03:37:08 I can change it, it's not mine anymore.
03:37:10 Thank you.
03:37:11 Madam Mayor, Mr. Mayor Pro Tem, and members of the council.
03:37:14 For consent, I have items one through five
03:37:18 And items seven through 21 and for GBA public hearings,
03:37:23 they would be items 24 through 26.
03:37:27 Thank you.
03:37:29 Thank you. Is there a motion to settle the agenda?
03:37:31 Move to settle.
03:37:32 Second.
03:37:33 Okay, it was moved by Mayor Pro Tem, seconded by Councilwoman Carbier.
03:37:39 All those in favor, if you're signed, say aye.
03:37:41 Aye.
03:37:41 All those opposed, have the same right.
03:37:44 Hearing none, our agenda is settled.
03:37:47 I thank you all for my very last work session,
03:37:51 for all the hard work from our staff and everybody.
03:37:56 I've enjoyed working with you all somewhat.
03:37:59 I'm glad this chapter is moving on in my life.
03:38:03 Mayor Pro Tem.
03:38:04 Yes, ma'am.
03:38:05 That's my only regret, is that you became my mayor pro tem.
03:38:10 That's my only regret.
03:38:11 With that, I'll adjourn.
03:38:12 Thank you, ma'am.
03:38:14 437, 1121, 2023.
03:38:17 Don't make the same mistake, Leo.
03:38:30 I mean that.
03:38:44 you
